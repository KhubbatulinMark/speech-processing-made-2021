103-1240-0012 HAD IT BEEN ANY OTHER MAN IN AVONLEA MISSUS RACHEL DEFTLY PUTTING THIS AND THAT TOGETHER MIGHT HAVE GIVEN A PRETTY GOOD GUESS AS TO BOTH QUESTIONS BUT MATTHEW SO RARELY WENT FROM HOME THAT IT MUST BE SOMETHING PRESSING AND UNUSUAL WHICH WAS TAKING HIM
103-1240-0026 AND HERE SHE SAT NOW KNITTING AND THE TABLE BEHIND HER WAS LAID FOR SUPPER MISSUS RACHEL BEFORE SHE HAD FAIRLY CLOSED THE DOOR
103-1240-0040 THERE'S NEVER ANYBODY TO BE HAD BUT THOSE STUPID HALF GROWN LITTLE FRENCH BOYS AND AS SOON AS YOU DO GET ONE BROKE INTO YOUR WAYS AND TAUGHT SOMETHING HE'S UP AND OFF TO THE LOBSTER CANNERIES OR THE STATES AT FIRST MATTHEW SUGGESTED GETTING A HOME BOY BUT I SAID NO FLAT TO THAT
103-1240-0047 AND I KNOW ANOTHER CASE WHERE AN ADOPTED BOY USED TO SUCK THE EGGS THEY COULDN'T BREAK HIM OF IT IF YOU HAD ASKED MY ADVICE IN THE MATTER WHICH YOU DIDN'T DO MARILLA I'D HAVE SAID FOR MERCY'S SAKE NOT TO THINK OF SUCH A THING THAT'S WHAT
103-1240-0054 AND MISSUS RACHEL DEARLY LOVED TO MAKE A SENSATION SO SHE TOOK HERSELF AWAY SOMEWHAT TO MARILLA'S RELIEF FOR THE LATTER FELT HER DOUBTS AND FEARS REVIVING UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF MISSUS RACHEL'S PESSIMISM WELL OF ALL THINGS THAT EVER WERE OR WILL BE EJACULATED MISSUS RACHEL WHEN SHE WAS SAFELY OUT IN THE LANE
103-1241-0010 GUESS THERE'S SOME MISTAKE HE SAID MISSUS SPENCER CAME OFF THE TRAIN WITH THAT GIRL AND GAVE HER INTO MY CHARGE SAID YOU AND YOUR SISTER WERE ADOPTING HER FROM AN ORPHAN ASYLUM AND THAT YOU WOULD BE ALONG FOR HER PRESENTLY THAT'S ALL I KNOW ABOUT IT AND I HAVEN'T GOT ANY MORE ORPHANS CONCEALED HEREABOUTS
103-1241-0017 WAS SO LUDICROUSLY AFRAID MATTHEW HOWEVER WAS SPARED THE ORDEAL OF SPEAKING FIRST FOR AS SOON AS SHE CONCLUDED THAT HE WAS COMING TO HER SHE STOOD UP GRASPING WITH ONE THIN BROWN HAND THE HANDLE OF A SHABBY OLD FASHIONED CARPET BAG THE OTHER SHE HELD OUT TO HIM
103-1241-0024 WE'VE GOT TO DRIVE A LONG PIECE HAVEN'T WE MISSUS SPENCER SAID IT WAS EIGHT MILES I'M GLAD BECAUSE I LOVE DRIVING OH IT SEEMS SO WONDERFUL THAT I'M GOING TO LIVE WITH YOU AND BELONG TO YOU I'VE NEVER BELONGED TO ANYBODY NOT REALLY BUT THE ASYLUM WAS THE WORST I'VE ONLY BEEN IN IT FOUR MONTHS BUT THAT WAS ENOUGH
103-1241-0038 AND I USED TO IMAGINE I WAS LIVING HERE BUT I NEVER REALLY EXPECTED I WOULD IT'S DELIGHTFUL WHEN YOUR IMAGINATIONS COME TRUE ISN'T IT BUT THOSE RED ROADS ARE SO FUNNY WHEN WE GOT INTO THE TRAIN AT CHARLOTTETOWN AND THE RED ROADS BEGAN TO FLASH PAST I ASKED MISSUS SPENCER WHAT MADE THEM RED
1034-121119-0001 THE FACT BEING THAT EVERY ONE WAS TOO MUCH OCCUPIED IN HIS OR HER OWN AFFAIRS TO THINK OF THEIRS WE WILL LEAVE THE BANKER CONTEMPLATING THE ENORMOUS MAGNITUDE OF HIS DEBT BEFORE THE PHANTOM OF BANKRUPTCY AND FOLLOW THE BARONESS
1034-121119-0008 HAD RETIRED IN HASTE TO HIS CLUB WHERE HE WAS CHATTING WITH SOME FRIENDS UPON THE EVENTS WHICH SERVED AS A SUBJECT OF CONVERSATION FOR THREE FOURTHS OF THAT CITY KNOWN AS THE CAPITAL OF THE WORLD AT THE PRECISE TIME WHEN MADAME DANGLARS DRESSED IN BLACK AND CONCEALED IN A LONG VEIL
1034-121119-0021 FOR IN A SOCIETY SUCH AS OURS SATIRE INFLICTS A PAINFUL AND INCURABLE WOUND
1034-121119-0028 IT WAS NOT THE EXECUTIONER BUT THE SURGEON WHO WISHED TO WITHDRAW THE HONOR OF DANGLARS FROM IGNOMINIOUS ASSOCIATION WITH THE DISGRACED YOUNG MAN THEY HAD PRESENTED TO THE WORLD AS THEIR SON IN LAW AND SINCE VILLEFORT THE FRIEND OF DANGLARS HAD ACTED IN THIS WAY
1034-121119-0035 AND THE NEIGHBORS WOULD SAY TO EACH OTHER IN A LOW VOICE
1034-121119-0049 RAISING HIS HEAD BOWED DOWN BY GRIEF LOOKED UP AT HER WITH SO SAD A SMILE THAT HER COMPLAINTS DIED UPON HER LIPS FORGIVE MY SERVANTS HE SAID FOR A TERROR I CANNOT BLAME THEM FOR FROM BEING SUSPECTED THEY HAVE BECOME SUSPICIOUS
1034-121119-0056 SAID THE BARONESS SPEAK TO ME NOT AS A MAGISTRATE BUT AS A FRIEND AND WHEN I AM IN BITTER ANGUISH OF SPIRIT DO NOT TELL ME THAT I OUGHT TO BE GAY VILLEFORT BOWED WHEN I HEAR MISFORTUNES NAMED MADAME
1034-121119-0063 IMPOSSIBLE MADAME JUSTICE HAS ITS FORMALITIES WHAT EVEN FOR ME SAID THE BARONESS HALF JESTING HALF IN EARNEST FOR ALL EVEN FOR MYSELF AMONG THE REST
1034-121119-0077 HAS THE LAW A MEMORY FOR ALL THOSE SOFT RECOLLECTIONS YOU ENDEAVOR TO RECALL NO MADAME
1034-121119-0084 WITH A FEVERISH RAGE WHICH GAVE A FEROCIOUS ELOQUENCE TO HIS WORDS
1034-121119-0091 I SOMETIMES LOSE ALL RECOLLECTION OF THE PAST AND THEN I EXPERIENCE THE SAME SORT OF HAPPINESS I CAN IMAGINE THE DEAD FEEL STILL IT IS BETTER THAN SUFFERING BUT SIR HE HAS FLED LET HIM ESCAPE INACTION IS A PARDONABLE OFFENCE
1040-133433-0009 MIND YOU I AM NOT SURE THAT WE HAVE A DRAWING ROOM BUT WE PRETEND WE HAVE AND IT'S ALL THE SAME HOOP LA HE WENT OFF DANCING THROUGH THE HOUSE AND THEY ALL CRIED HOOP LA AND DANCED AFTER HIM SEARCHING FOR THE DRAWING ROOM AND I FORGET WHETHER THEY FOUND IT
1040-133433-0016 BUT WHERE ARE YOU GOING TO LIVE WITH TINK IN THE HOUSE WE BUILT FOR WENDY THE FAIRIES ARE TO PUT IT HIGH UP AMONG THE TREE TOPS WHERE THEY SLEEP AT NIGHTS HOW LOVELY CRIED WENDY SO LONGINGLY THAT MISSUS DARLING TIGHTENED HER GRIP I THOUGHT ALL THE FAIRIES WERE DEAD MISSUS DARLING SAID
1040-133433-0023 THE KISS THAT HAD BEEN FOR NO ONE ELSE PETER TOOK QUITE EASILY FUNNY BUT SHE SEEMED SATISFIED OF COURSE ALL THE BOYS WENT TO SCHOOL
1040-133433-0036 ALL THE BOYS WERE GROWN UP AND DONE FOR BY THIS TIME SO IT IS SCARCELY WORTH WHILE SAYING ANYTHING MORE ABOUT THEM YOU MAY SEE THE TWINS AND NIBS AND CURLY ANY DAY GOING TO AN OFFICE EACH CARRYING A LITTLE BAG AND AN UMBRELLA
1040-133433-0050 YES THAT WAS IT SAYS JANE WITH A BIG BREATH AND THEN HE FLEW US ALL AWAY TO THE NEVERLAND AND THE FAIRIES AND THE PIRATES AND THE REDSKINS AND THE MERMAID'S LAGOON
1040-133433-0064 WHAT IS IT HE CRIED SHRINKING
1040-133433-0071 AND WENDY DID NOT KNOW HOW TO COMFORT HIM THOUGH SHE COULD HAVE DONE IT SO EASILY ONCE SHE WAS ONLY A WOMAN NOW AND SHE RAN OUT OF THE ROOM TO TRY TO THINK PETER CONTINUED TO CRY AND SOON HIS SOBS WOKE JANE
1040-133433-0078 OUR LAST GLIMPSE OF HER SHOWS HER AT THE WINDOW
1069-133699-0011 WHICH EXCITED A VEIN OF COUNTER ARGUMENT ON THE PART OF THE CORRESPONDENT OF THE INTERVIEWER WHO IN THE EXERCISE OF HER PROFESSION HAD ACQUAINTED HERSELF IN THE WESTERN WORLD WITH EVERY FORM OF CARAVANSARY
1069-133699-0018 SHOULD YOU LIKE ME BETTER IF I WERE YOUR BUTLER DEAR HER HUSBAND ASKED I DON'T THINK I SHOULD YOU WOULDN'T AT ALL HAVE THE TENUE THE COMPANIONS OF FREEMEN I LIKE THAT MISS STACKPOLE SAID RALPH
1069-133699-0025 ISABEL RESPONDED YOU SAY THAT RIGHT I HAD A GOOD DEAL OF TALK WITH HIM HE HAS COME AFTER YOU DID HE TELL YOU SO NO HE TOLD ME NOTHING THAT'S HOW I KNEW IT SAID HENRIETTA CLEVERLY
1069-133699-0039 I HOPE HE'LL HATE ME THEN SAID ISABEL I BELIEVE YOU HOPE IT ABOUT AS MUCH AS I BELIEVE HIM CAPABLE OF IT TO THIS OBSERVATION OUR HEROINE MADE NO RETURN
1069-133699-0046 IT SEEMED TO HER AT LAST THAT SHE WOULD DO WELL TO TAKE A BOOK FORMERLY WHEN HEAVY HEARTED SHE HAD BEEN ABLE WITH THE HELP OF SOME WELL CHOSEN VOLUME TO TRANSFER THE SEAT OF CONSCIOUSNESS TO THE ORGAN OF PURE REASON
1069-133699-0053 IT IS ONLY BECAUSE IT HOLDS YOU I HAVE BEEN TO ENGLAND BEFORE BUT HAVE NEVER ENJOYED IT MUCH MAY I NOT COME AND SEE YOU FOR HALF AN HOUR THIS AT PRESENT IS THE DEAREST WISH OF YOURS FAITHFULLY
1069-133709-0012 THAT SHE SHOULD HAVE GONE THE LONGEST WAY ROUND TO FLORENCE IN ORDER TO SPEND A FEW WEEKS WITH HER INVALID SON
1069-133709-0019 YOU SEEM TO ME TROUBLED SAID RALPH I AM TROUBLED ABOUT WHAT FOR A MOMENT SHE ANSWERED NOTHING THEN SHE BROKE OUT DO YOU THINK IT GOOD FOR ME SUDDENLY TO BE MADE SO RICH
1069-133709-0026 BUT I THINK I'M RIGHT SAID RALPH PERSISTING IN CHEER ALL THE SAME WHAT YOU SAY IS VERY TRUE ISABEL PURSUED YOU COULD SAY NOTHING MORE TRUE I'M ABSORBED IN MYSELF I LOOK AT LIFE TOO MUCH AS A DOCTOR'S PRESCRIPTION
1069-133709-0040 SHE COULD SUMMON BACK HER FAITH IN CASE OF NEED WITH AN EFFORT BUT THE EFFORT WAS OFTEN PAINFUL EVEN WHEN THE REALITY HAD BEEN PLEASANT THE PAST WAS APT TO LOOK DEAD AND ITS REVIVAL RATHER TO SHOW THE
1069-133709-0047 SEEMED TO HER MORE THAN A NOBLE HUMILITY OR AN ENLIGHTENED PRIDE OUGHT TO WISH TO RECKON WITH SHE HAD SO DEFINITELY UNDERTAKEN TO PRESERVE NO RECORD OF WHAT HAD PASSED BETWEEN THEM THAT A CORRESPONDING EFFORT ON HIS OWN PART
1081-125237-0001 HIS READINESS AND PERSUASIVENESS OF SPEECH HIS INDUSTRY AND HIS GIFTS AT ONCE OF SWIFT INSIGHT AND ORDERLY THOROUGHNESS
1081-125237-0015 AS THEY HAD REFUSED THE OFFER OF FRIENDSHIP THAT HAD BEEN MADE TO THEM IT WAS RESOLVED THAT STRONG MEASURES SHOULD BE TAKEN TO OBTAIN REDRESS FOR PAST GRIEVANCES AND FOR THE PROTECTION OF ENGLISH TRADE INTERESTS AT THE INSTANCE OF SAINT JOHN
1081-125237-0022 THEY FURTHER DEMANDED THAT DUTCH COMMANDERS SHOULD ACKNOWLEDGE ENGLAND'S SOVEREIGNTY BY STRIKING FLAG AND SAIL AND BY FIRING A SALUTE WHENEVER ANY OF THEIR SQUADRONS MET ENGLISH SHIPS IN THE NARROW SEAS IT WAS THESE LAST TWO QUESTIONS
1081-125237-0029 TROMP DECLARED THAT HE HAD GIVEN ORDERS TO STRIKE THE FLAG BUT THAT BLAKE AGAIN FIRED BEFORE THERE WAS TIME TO CARRY THEM OUT BE THIS AS IT MAY THE TWO FLEETS WERE SOON ENGAGED IN A REGULAR FIGHT AND THE ENGLISH BEING REINFORCED TROMP WITHDREW AT NIGHTFALL
1081-125237-0043 TROMP WAS PREVENTED FROM FOLLOWING BLAKE BY STRONG NORTHERLY WINDS HE THEN TURNED UPON AYSCUE WHOSE SMALL FORCE HE MUST HAVE OVERWHELMED BUT FOR A SUDDEN CHANGE TO A SOUTHERLY GALE THE DUTCH ADMIRAL NOW SAILED NORTHWARDS AND JULY TWENTY FIFTH
1081-125237-0050 BUT THEY WERE DECEIVED IN THINKING THAT THE STRUGGLE IN THE CHANNEL WAS OVER FOR THE WINTER THE DESERTERS AT THE KENTISH KNOCK WERE PUNISHED
1081-125237-0057 MEANWHILE BOTH NATIONS HAD BEEN GETTING SICK OF THE WAR THE DUTCH WERE SUFFERING TERRIBLY FROM THE SERIOUS INTERFERENCE WITH THEIR COMMERCE AND CARRYING TRADE AND FROM THE DESTRUCTION OF THE IMPORTANT FISHERIES INDUSTRY
1081-125237-0070 UNA RESPUBLICA WHICH NOTHING BUT SHEER CONQUEST AND DIRE NECESSITY WOULD EVER INDUCE THE DUTCH PEOPLE TO ACCEPT ACCORDINGLY THE WAR WENT ON THOUGH THE ENVOYS DID NOT LEAVE LONDON HOPING STILL THAT SOME BETTER TERMS MIGHT BE OFFERED
1081-125237-0084 HE WAS ABLE TO REACH THE PRIVATE EAR OF CROMWELL AND TO ENTER INTO CLANDESTINE NEGOTIATIONS WITH HIM THE COUNCIL PENSIONARY KNEW WELL THE HOPELESSNESS OF ANY ATTEMPT TO GET THE ASSENT OF THE STATES GENERAL TO THE PROPOSED EXCLUSION EVEN IN A SECRET ARTICLE
1081-125237-0098 BUT AS IT WAS ESSENTIAL TO PREVENT PUBLICITY IT WAS SETTLED THAT ONLY THE BURGOMASTERS SHOULD BE CONSULTED AGAIN UNDER OATH OF SECRECY AT THE MEETING ON MAY FIRST
1081-125237-0105 ALL THE SECRET INSTRUCTIONS THEY HAD RECEIVED FROM HOLLAND AND THE ACT OF EXCLUSION MEANWHILE THE ESTATES OF HOLLAND THEMSELVES FRIGHTENED AT THE CLAMOUR WHICH HAD BEEN AROUSED BEGAN TO SHOW SIGNS OF DEFECTION
1081-125237-0112 AND FROM THE SKILL AND COURAGE WITH WHICH HE ACHIEVED HIS END IN THE FACE OF OBSTACLES AND DIFFICULTIES THAT SEEMED INSURMOUNTABLE BUT FOR THE COURSE OF DOUBLE DEALING AND CHICANERY BY WHICH HE TRIUMPHED THE ONLY DEFENCE THAT CAN BE OFFERED IS THAT THE COUNCIL PENSIONARY
1081-128618-0010 ADD THE STRAINED VINEGAR THE BEATEN YOLKS OF SIX EGGS AND TWO TABLESPOONFULS OF GRATED HORSERADISH BRING TO THE BOIL POUR OVER THE FISH AND SERVE PERCH A LA STANLEY
1088-129236-0003 ESTABLISHES MARRIAGE AND GIVES PERMANENCE TO HUMAN SOCIETY THE NATURAL ASSOCIATION OF THE SENTIMENT OF LOVE WITH THE HEYDAY OF THE BLOOD SEEMS TO REQUIRE THAT IN ORDER TO PORTRAY IT IN VIVID TINTS WHICH EVERY YOUTH AND MAID SHOULD CONFESS TO BE TRUE TO THEIR THROBBING EXPERIENCE
1088-129236-0010 WHICH HAVE GIVEN HIM SINCEREST INSTRUCTION AND NOURISHMENT HE WILL SHRINK AND MOAN ALAS I KNOW NOT WHY BUT INFINITE COMPUNCTIONS EMBITTER IN MATURE LIFE THE REMEMBRANCES OF BUDDING JOY AND COVER EVERY BELOVED NAME
1088-129236-0024 ALL OTHER PLEASURES ARE NOT WORTH ITS PAINS AND WHEN THE DAY WAS NOT LONG ENOUGH BUT THE NIGHT TOO MUST BE CONSUMED IN KEEN RECOLLECTIONS WHEN THE HEAD BOILED ALL NIGHT ON THE PILLOW WITH THE GENEROUS DEED IT RESOLVED ON
1088-134315-0000 AS YOU KNOW AND AS I HAVE GIVEN YOU PROOF I HAVE THE GREATEST ADMIRATION IN THE WORLD FOR ONE WHOSE WORK FOR HUMANITY HAS WON SUCH UNIVERSAL RECOGNITION I HOPE THAT WE SHALL BOTH FORGET THIS UNHAPPY MORNING AND THAT YOU WILL GIVE ME AN OPPORTUNITY OF RENDERING TO YOU IN PERSON
1088-134315-0007 WHIP A MAN AND THE MEMORY OF IT PASSES FRIGHTEN HIM FILL HIM WITH A SENSE OF FOREBODING AND APPREHENSION AND LET HIM BELIEVE THAT SOMETHING DREADFUL IS GOING TO HAPPEN EITHER TO HIMSELF OR TO SOMEONE HE LOVES BETTER THE LATTER
1088-134315-0021 HE WILL PROBABLY BE INTERESTED IF YOU TAKE HIM INTO THE LIBRARY VERY GOOD SIR SAID THE URBANE FISHER WILL YOU CHANGE BEFORE YOU GO OUT KARA SHOOK HIS HEAD I THINK I WILL GO AS I AM HE SAID GET ME MY FUR COAT THIS BEASTLY COLD KILLS ME
1088-134315-0028 ANSWERING LETTERS APPEALING FOR CHARITABLE DONATIONS AND IN THE HACK WORDS WHICH FALL TO THE SECRETARIES OF THE GREAT HE REPLENISHED THE FIRE ASKED DEFERENTIALLY FOR ANY INSTRUCTIONS AND RETURNED AGAIN TO HIS QUEST
1088-134315-0035 A PAIR OF PINCE NEZ SAT CROOKEDLY ON HIS NOSE AND TWO FAT VOLUMES UNDER HIS ARM COMPLETED THE PICTURE FISHER WHO WAS AN OBSERVER OF SOME DISCERNMENT NOTICED UNDER THE OVERCOAT A CREASED BLUE SUIT LARGE BLACK BOOTS
1088-134315-0049 BUT HER MIND WAS VERY FAR FROM THE CORRESPONDENCE BEFORE HER SHE HEARD THE SOFT THUD OF THE FRONT DOOR CLOSING AND RISING SHE CROSSED THE ROOM RAPIDLY AND LOOKED DOWN THROUGH THE WINDOW TO THE STREET SHE WATCHED FISHER UNTIL HE WAS OUT OF SIGHT
1088-134315-0056 IN TWO SECONDS IT WAS OPEN AND SHE WAS EXAMINING ITS CONTENTS IT WAS A LARGE SAFE OF THE USUAL TYPE THERE WERE FOUR STEEL DRAWERS FITTED AT THE BACK AND AT THE BOTTOM OF THE STRONG BOX
1088-134318-0004 HE REMEMBERED THE DAY WELL BECAUSE IT WAS CANDLEMAS DAY AND THIS WAS THE ANNIVERSARY HE REMEMBERED OTHER THINGS MORE PLEASANT
1088-134318-0018 DAMN ALL GREEKS HE SAID JOVIALLY AND FISHER COULD DO NO MORE THAN SMILE REPROACHFULLY THE SMILE BEING HIS VERY OWN THE REPROACH BEING ON BEHALF OF THE MASTER WHO PAID HIM THE TRAVELLER TOUCHED THE OTHER ON THE CHEST WITH HIS RIGHT HAND NEVER TRUST A GREEK HE SAID
1098-133695-0003 AND HAD MASTERED THE SOVEREIGN TRUTH THAT NOTHING IN THIS WORLD IS GOT FOR NOTHING SHE HAD PLAYED NO SOCIAL PART AS MISTRESS OF GARDENCOURT AND IT WAS NOT TO BE SUPPOSED THAT IN THE SURROUNDING COUNTRY A MINUTE ACCOUNT SHOULD BE KEPT OF HER COMINGS AND GOINGS
1098-133695-0010 ISABEL THOUGHT THIS A BETTER ANSWER THAN SHE ADMITTED IT WAS A TOLERABLE DESCRIPTION OF HER OWN MANNER OF JUDGING BUT IT WOULD NOT HAVE SOUNDED WELL FOR HER TO SAY SO
1098-133695-0024 AND HER SATISFACTION WAS AT THE ROOT OF THE GOOD SPIRITS WHICH ENABLED HER TO TAKE HER COUSIN'S CHAFF
1098-133695-0031 THE OLD MAN HAD BEEN GRAVELY ILL IN THE SPRING AND THE DOCTORS HAD WHISPERED TO RALPH THAT ANOTHER ATTACK WOULD BE LESS EASY TO DEAL WITH JUST NOW HE APPEARED DISBURDENED OF PAIN BUT RALPH COULD NOT RID HIMSELF OF A SUSPICION THAT THIS WAS A SUBTERFUGE OF THE ENEMY
1098-133695-0038 HE WONDERED WHETHER HE WERE HARBOURING LOVE FOR THIS SPONTANEOUS YOUNG WOMAN FROM ALBANY BUT HE JUDGED THAT ON THE WHOLE HE WAS NOT AFTER HE HAD KNOWN HER FOR A WEEK HE QUITE MADE UP HIS MIND TO THIS AND EVERY DAY HE FELT A LITTLE MORE SURE
1098-133695-0051 BUT WHICH HE HAD NOW CEASED TO ENJOY ISABEL ENJOYED IT LARGELY AND HANDLING THE REINS IN A MANNER WHICH APPROVED ITSELF TO THE GROOM AS KNOWING WAS NEVER WEARY OF DRIVING HER UNCLE'S CAPITAL HORSES THROUGH WINDING LANES AND BYWAYS
1098-133695-0058 HE HAD INDEED RATHER SHARPLY REGISTERED HIMSELF ON HER FINE SENSE AND SHE HAD THOUGHT OF HIM SEVERAL TIMES SHE HAD HOPED SHE SHOULD SEE HIM AGAIN HOPED TOO THAT SHE SHOULD SEE A FEW OTHERS GARDENCOURT WAS NOT DULL
1098-133695-0065 WELL NOW THERE'S A SPECIMEN HE SAID TO HER AS THEY WALKED UP FROM THE RIVERSIDE AND HE RECOGNISED LORD WARBURTON A SPECIMEN OF WHAT ASKED THE GIRL A SPECIMEN OF AN ENGLISH GENTLEMAN DO YOU MEAN THEY'RE ALL LIKE HIM
1098-133695-0079 THE OCCASION WORE TO HER SENSE A FESTIVE CHARACTER AND FEASTS WERE NOT IN THE HABIT OF TERMINATING SO EARLY SO WITHOUT FURTHER THOUGHT SHE REPLIED VERY SIMPLY NEED I GO DEAR AUNT I'LL COME UP IN HALF AN HOUR
1098-133695-0086 MISSUS TOUCHETT GAVE A LITTLE LOOK OF DESPAIR AND SAT DOWN AGAIN
1116-132847-0001 AND SOON THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN HEARD BEWAILING TO EACH OTHER THE HARDNESS OF THEIR LOTS
1116-132847-0015 AS SOON AS THE YOUNG MAN HAD RECOVERED FROM HIS SURPRISE HE PREPARED TO JUMP INTO THE LAKE AND SWIM TO SHORE BUT THE BIRD HAD GUESSED HIS INTENTIONS AND PLUNGED BENEATH THE WATER
1116-132847-0022 BUT IT DID NOT SOUND THE LEAST LIKE THAT TO HOUARN THERE IT IS AGAIN HE SAID AFTER A SHORT PAUSE
1116-132847-0029 THE SWALLOW IS LESS SWIFT THAN THE WIND THE WIND IS LESS SWIFT THAN THE LIGHTNING BUT YOU MY HORSE IF YOU LOVE ME MUST BE SWIFTER THAN THEM ALL FOR THERE IS A PART OF MY HEART THAT SUFFERS THE BEST PART OF MY HEART THAT IS IN DANGER AND THE HORSE HEARD HER
1116-132851-0002 ONE EVENING HE WAS BRINGING BACK HIS HORSES FROM THE FIELDS AND STOPPED AT A LITTLE LAKE ON THE WAY HOME TO LET THEM DRINK HE WAS TIRED WITH A LONG DAY'S WORK AND STOOD WITH HIS HAND ON THE MANE OF ONE OF THE ANIMALS WAITING TILL THEY HAD DONE AND THINKING ALL THE WHILE OF BARBAIK
1116-132851-0009 AS SHE WISHED TO GET THROUGH HER WORK AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AND BE READY TO START FOR A DANCE WHICH WAS TO BE HELD SOME DISTANCE OFF SHE WENT FIRST TO THE COW HOUSE WHICH IT WAS HER DUTY TO KEEP CLEAN BUT TO HER AMAZEMENT SHE FOUND FRESH STRAW PUT DOWN
1116-132851-0016 AND THIS TIME THE GIRL DID NOT TURN RUDELY AWAY BUT LISTENED PATIENTLY TO THE END
1116-137572-0001 HIS BEAMING FACE MASKS A STIFF DETERMINATION TO KEEP HIS BRIDE HAPPY IN SPITE OF ANY WORLDLY OBSTACLES HER RADIANCE HIDES A SOLEMN INWARD VOW TO DO EVERYTHING HUMANLY POSSIBLE TO MAKE SMOOTH THE WAY OF THEIR LIFE TOGETHER THEY ARE RIGHT
1116-137572-0008 AND DISADVANTAGES WITH WHICH THE COUPLE ENTER MARRIAGE THESE TRAITS CANNOT BE CHANGED OVERNIGHT NOR IS IT NECESSARY OR AT ALL WISE THAT THEY SHOULD BE JOHN ATTRACTS MARY AND SHE APPEALS TO HIM BECAUSE THE PERSONALITY OF EACH ONE IS WHAT IT IS
1116-137572-0015 COMPROMISE WILL LIFT THESE ESSENTIALLY PETTY DECISIONS OF PRECEDENCE ABOVE THE LEVEL OF SELFISHNESS DECISIONS MUST BE MADE ON THE BASIS OF WHAT IS GOOD FOR BOTH NOT THE SELFISH OR NARROW WISH OF EITHER
1116-137572-0029 USING THE MATE FOR RELIEF AS IN NAGGING WHINING CRYING OR GRUMBLING IS TABOO IF YOU ARE TIRED OR IRRITABLE YOU CAN REST OR EXERCISE FOR RESTORATION AS IN THE DAYS BEFORE MARRIAGE
1116-137572-0036 THE WIFE MAY BE ALONE PART OF THE DAY AND PROFIT BY IT WHEN JOHN COMES HOME AT NIGHT HE HAS NOT HAD THAT PRIVILEGE
1116-137572-0043 MATURITY BRINGS RECOGNITION OF HUMAN IMPERFECTIONS IN THE MOST HEROIC BUT ALSO DEVELOPS THE ABILITY TO WEIGH BIG AND LITTLE THINGS AND TO
118-121721-0001 WONDERFUL PARENTS ARE YET TO BE HEARD FROM WHO DON'T THINK THEIRS IS A WONDER A NOCTURNAL ANIMAL TO WHICH EVERYONE IN A SLEEPING CAR IS EAGER TO GIVE A WIDE BERTH BACHELOR FROM LATIN BACULUS A STICK UNATTACHED

118-121721-0015 MUSCULAR FILAMENTS OF THE FACIAL CAPILLARIES WHEREBY BEING DIVESTED OF THEIR ELASTICITY
118-124588-0001 NOTHING FURTHER COULD BE DONE IN THE WAY OF SEARCHING FOR THE LATTER PERSONAGE UNTIL DAYLIGHT IT WAS GETTING ON PRETTY WELL TOWARDS MORNING WHEN MISSUS SAVAREEN SOUGHT HER COUCH AND WHEN SHE GOT THERE HER SLUMBER WAS BROKEN AND DISTURBED SHE KNEW NOT WHAT TO THINK
118-124588-0008 BUT THE HORSE WHICH HAD DISAPPEARED IN THIS UNACCOUNTABLE MANNER IT SEEMED IMPROBABLE THAT TWO LIVING SUBSTANCES OF SUCH BULK SHOULD PASS OUT OF BEING AND LEAVE NO TRACE BEHIND THEM THEY MUST LITERALLY HAVE MELTED INTO THIN AIR NO THEY HADN'T AT LEAST THE BLACK MARE HADN'T
118-124588-0015 IN FACT HE HAD NOT WORN IT FOR MORE THAN A WEEK PREVIOUSLY HIS WIFE DISTINCTLY REMEMBERED HAVING FOLDED AND LAID IT AWAY IN THE TOP OF A LARGE TRUNK ON THE SATURDAY OF THE WEEK BEFORE LAST SINCE WHICH TIME SHE HAD NEVER SET EYES ON IT HERE WAS A DEEPENING OF THE MYSTERY

125-121124-0085 AFTER EXPRESSING ACUTE SYMPATHY WITH THE FATHER
125-121342-0003 IN THE STREET THE LAMPS OF THE TAXI CABS SENT OUT GLISTENING SHEENS ALONG THE ALREADY BLACK PAVEMENT THE UNWELCOME NOVEMBER RAIN HAD PERVERSELY STOLEN THE DAY'S LAST HOUR AND PAWNED IT WITH THAT ANCIENT FENCE THE NIGHT
125-121342-0010 AND THE NUMEROUS UNPLEASANT ASPECTS OF CITY LIFE WITHOUT MONEY OCCURRED TO HIM IN THREATENING PROCESSION THERE WAS THE GHASTLY STINKING CRUSH OF THE SUBWAY THE CAR CARDS THRUSTING THEMSELVES AT ONE LEERING OUT LIKE DULL BORES WHO GRAB YOUR ARM WITH ANOTHER STORY
125-121342-0024 I CAN'T IMAGINE NOT BEING ABLE TO
125-121342-0031 NONE I'VE NO MORE VIRTUE TO LOSE JUST AS A COOLING POT GIVES OFF HEAT SO ALL THROUGH YOUTH AND ADOLESCENCE WE GIVE OFF CALORIES OF VIRTUE THAT'S WHAT'S CALLED INGENUOUSNESS QUESTION AN INTERESTING IDEA
125-121342-0038 THEY DON'T THEY JUST WANT THE FUN OF EATING IT ALL OVER AGAIN THE MATRON DOESN'T WANT TO REPEAT HER GIRLHOOD SHE WANTS TO REPEAT HER HONEYMOON
1263-138246-0003 GAS WAS NOT INVENTED FOR MOLES SO SAYING THE THOUGHTLESS FELLOW LIT A MATCH BY STRIKING IT ON THE SOLE OF HIS BOOT AND APPROACHED THE BURNER FIXED TO THE RECEPTACLE IN WHICH THE CARBONIZED HYDROGEN
1263-138246-0010 MURCHISON WILL LAUNCH THE ELECTRIC SPARK ON THE WIRE WHICH COMMUNICATES WITH THE CHARGE OF THE COLUMBIAD AT THAT PRECISE MOMENT WE SHALL LEAVE OUR SPHEROID THUS WE STILL HAVE TWENTY SEVEN MINUTES TO REMAIN ON THE EARTH
1263-138246-0017 WE HAVE NOW TO DECIDE HOW WE CAN BEST PLACE OURSELVES TO RESIST THE SHOCK POSITION CANNOT BE AN INDIFFERENT MATTER AND WE MUST AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE PREVENT THE RUSH OF BLOOD TO THE HEAD
1263-138246-0031 REPLIED BARBICANE SIMPLY AND IF NICHOLL IS NOT THERE IT WILL GO TO HIS HEIRS AH YOU PRACTICAL MEN EXCLAIMED MICHEL ARDAN I ADMIRE YOU THE MORE FOR NOT BEING ABLE TO UNDERSTAND YOU
1263-139804-0001 THEY ARE NEARLY AS LARGE AS WE AND RELATIVELY MUCH LIGHTER IN WEIGHT ALL THE PERIODS OF PHYSICAL GROWTH ARE CORRESPONDINGLY DECREASED CHILDREN WALK FOUR OR FIVE WEEKS AFTER BIRTH
1263-139804-0008 THERE BEING NO COMPETITION NO TIME OR SPACE IS REQUIRED FOR SENSATIONAL TRASH THUS IF NOTHING OF IMPORTANCE OCCURS NOTHING NEED BE TRANSMITTED THE OFFICIAL NEWS CENSORS DECIDE AS TO THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF OCCURRENCES
1263-139804-0022 PUBLIC HIGHWAYS THESE INTERESTING PEOPLE EXCEL US IN THEIR STYLE AND MANNER OF HOME BUILDING FENCING AND MAKING PUBLIC HIGHWAYS WE ARE HEATHENISH IN OUR PROGRESS ALONG THE LINE OF ROAD MAKING ESPECIALLY
1263-139804-0029 AND THAT HIS FOLLOWERS WOULD LOSE THE THRONE OF CIVIL POWER THAT THEY WOULD BE TESTED FOR A SEASON IN THE VALLEY OF HUMILIATION AND BY THE FIRES OF TERRIBLE PERSECUTION AND THAT THEY WHO WOULD ENDURE UNTO THE END WOULD BE GLORIFIED
1263-141777-0006 TO GO BACK TO THE SHIP CLEARING WAS TO RISK CAPTURE BUT HE HAD TO KNOW RYNCH LOOKED WITH MORE ATTENTION AT HIS PRESENT SURROUNDINGS DEEP MOLD UNDER THE TREES HERE WOULD HOLD TRACKS THERE MIGHT JUST BE ANOTHER WAY TO MOVE
1263-141777-0020 SHRUGGING HIS ARMS INTO A WEBBING HARNESS WHICH BROUGHT A BOX AGAINST HIS CHEST HAVING MADE THAT FAST HE PICKED UP A NEEDLER BY ITS SLING BY THEIR GESTURES THE OTHERS WERE ARGUING WITH HIM BUT HE SHOOK HIS HEAD CAME ON
1263-141777-0027 HOWEVER THE OTHER WAS AS WARY OF THAT DARK AS IF HE SUSPECTED WHAT MIGHT LIE IN WAIT THERE HE ANGLED ALONG NORTHWARD AVOIDING CLUMPS OF SCATTERED BRUSH KEEPING IN THE OPEN WHERE RYNCH DARED NOT TAIL HIM TOO CLOSELY
1263-141777-0034 THAT SOUND OF SNARLING SPITTING HATE ENDED IN MID CRY AS RYNCH CRAWLED TO THE RIVER BANK THE MAN FROM THE SPACER CAMP HAD BEEN THE FOCUS OF A THREE PRONG ATTACK FROM A FEMALE AND HER CUBS
1334-135589-0006 YOU ARE HERE HIGHLY SPOKEN OF SAID THE PRINCE FOR SO YOUNG A MAN SO YOU WERE AT THE AFFAIR OF WORCESTER WE WILL RETAIN YOU FOR YOUR SERVICES WILL BE WANTED BY AND BY
1334-135589-0013 CONDE OBTAINED THE VICTORY AT BLENAN AND IN APRIL SIXTEEN FIFTY TWO ADVANCED TO PARIS TURENNE WHO HAD TAKEN THE COMMAND OF THE FRENCH ARMY FOLLOWED HIM
1334-135589-0020 AND EXPELLED KING CHARLES FROM THE FRENCH FRONTIERS THE WAR WAS STILL CARRIED ON IN THE NETHERLANDS TURENNE BORE DOWN CONDE WHO HAD GAINED EVERY CAMPAIGN AND THE COURT OF SPAIN WEARIED WITH REVERSES
1334-135589-0033 FOR WHILE THEY HAD BEEN SPEAKING THE PROCESSION HAD STOPPED IS IT POSSIBLE THOUGHT EDWARD THAT THESE CAN BE THE TWO GIRLS IN RUSSET GOWNS THAT I LEFT AT THE COTTAGE AND YET IT MUST BE
1334-135589-0040 NOW EDWARD WHO DO YOU THINK WAS HERE TO DAY THE REIGNING BELLE AND THE TOAST OF ALL THE GENTLEMEN INDEED I MUST BE CAREFUL OF MY HEART DEAR EDITH WHO IS SHE
1334-135589-0047 AND FEEL THAT ALL HE ASSERTED TO HUMPHREY IS TRUE STILL I DO NOT LIKE THAT I SHOULD BE INDEBTED TO HIM FOR A PROPERTY WHICH IS MINE AND THAT HE HAS NO RIGHT TO GIVE I ACKNOWLEDGE HIS GENEROSITY
1334-135589-0061 AND NOW LET ME GIVE YOU SOME ADVICE FOR YOUR FRIENDS MASTERS CHALONER AND GRENVILLE THAT MUCH OF THEIR PROPERTY HAS BEEN TAKEN AWAY AND PUT INTO OTHER HANDS I KNOW AND PROBABLY THEY EXPECT IT WILL BE RESTORED UPON THEIR APPLICATION TO THE KING
1334-135589-0068 ON THE FOLLOWING DAY A DRAWING ROOM WAS TO BE HELD AND EDWARD'S SISTERS WERE TO BE PRESENTED EDWARD WAS STANDING WITH MANY OTHERS OF THE SUIT BEHIND THE CHAIR OF THE KING AMUSING HIMSELF WITH THE PRESENTATIONS AS THEY TOOK PLACE
1334-135589-0075 AND THEN HIS DAUGHTER WAS LED FORWARD AND INTRODUCED BY A LADY UNKNOWN TO EDWARD AFTER HE HAD SALUTED HER THE KING SAID LOUD ENOUGH FOR EDWARD TO HEAR
1334-135589-0089 TO A PROUD BROTHER OF MINE WHO DOES NOT DESERVE HER IT MAY BE SO EDITH REPLIED HUMPHREY WOMEN ARE RIDDLES I ONLY ARGUED UPON THE COMMON SENSE OF THE THING MUCH YOU KNOW ABOUT WOMEN
1334-135589-0096 NAY EDWARD RECOLLECT THAT I HAVE AS EDITH OBSERVED PASSED MY LIFE IN THE WOODS EDWARD WAS MOST KINDLY RECEIVED BY MISTER HEATHERSTONE EDWARD
1334-135589-0103 CLAIMED BY AN ELDERLY RELATION WHO LIVED IN THE COUNTRY AND WHOSE INFIRM STATE OF HEALTH DID NOT PERMIT HIM TO QUIT THE HOUSE HE LEFT HIS PROPERTY TO CLARA ABOUT A YEAR AFTER HER MARRIAGE TO HUMPHREY
1355-39947-0010 TO BE SURE WHILE NO ONE CAN BE HYPNOTIZED AGAINST HIS WILL MANY A PERSON IS LIABLE TO ACCEPT SUGGESTIONS FROM OTHERS AND THUS TO CARRY OUT THE WISHES OF OTHERS ALMOST WITHOUT KNOWING AND CERTAINLY WITHOUT WILLING THAT THE OTHER MIND INTERFERE WITH THE INTERPLAY OF THE OWN MOTIVES
1355-39947-0017 BELONGING THEREFORE ENTIRELY TO THE PURPOSIVE VIEW OF THE MIND BUT WE HAVE NOW REACHED A POINT WHERE IT IS OUR DUTY TO DO JUSTICE TO THIS PURPOSIVE VIEW TOO AS LONG AS WE DISCUSSED THE PROBLEM ENTIRELY FROM THE STANDPOINT OF THE PHYSICIAN
1355-39947-0024 PROFOUND EFFECT WHICH SUGGESTIVE THERAPEUTICS MAY CREATE MORE THAN THIS THEY HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE IT TO GAIN A BASIS FOR THEIR ATTACK JUST BECAUSE THE HYPNOTIZER CAN ENTIRELY CHANGE THE DESIRES AND PASSIONS THE HABITS AND PERVERSITIES OF THE SUFFERING VICTIM
1355-39947-0038 WHEN THAT MAN LEFT MY LABORATORY FOR THE LAST TIME TO GO OUT TO WORK AND HAPPINESS YOU MIGHT WELL HAVE BELIEVED FROM HIS JOYFUL FACE THAT IT HAD BEEN AN EASY AND PLEASANT TIME IN WHICH HYPNOTIC INFLUENCE SMOOTHLY REMOVED FROM HIM THE DANGEROUS DESIRE FOR MORPHINE
1355-39947-0045 BUT DID NOT SLEEP MORE THAN TWO OR THREE HOURS A DAY
1355-39947-0052 WE SHOULD HAVE TO MAKE UP OUR MINDS THAT ALL EDUCATION AND TRAINING WERE PERVERTED WITH SUCH IMMORAL ELEMENTS EVERY SOUND RESPECT FOR AUTHORITY WHICH MAKES A CHILD WILLING TO ACCEPT THE ADVICE AND MAXIMS OF HIS ELDERS IS JUST SUCH AN INFLUENCE
1355-39947-0066 IF IT IS NOT SUGGESTED BY THE INTERESTS OF THE SUBJECT HIMSELF SCIENCE HAS THE RIGHT TO MAKE HYPNOTIC EXPERIMENTS OR EXPERIMENTS WITH ABNORMAL MENTAL STATES ONLY UNDER THE ONE CONDITION THAT A PHYSICIAN HAS HYPNOTIZED THE SUBJECT IN THE INTERESTS OF HIS HEALTH
1355-39947-0073 NO THEORY OF THE WORLD AND OF GOD OUGHT TO GAIN AUTHORITY OVER THE MIND FROM SUCH AN EXTERNAL MOTIVE AS A BELIEF IN ITS CURATIVE EFFECTS FREEST FROM SUCH IMPLICATIONS IS CERTAINLY THE HYPNOTIC METHOD OF THE PHYSICIAN
1355-39947-0080 THAT THE PHYSICIAN ALONE IS CALLED TO ADMINISTER PSYCHOTHERAPEUTIC WORK BUT THAT HE NEEDS A THOROUGH PSYCHOLOGICAL TRAINING BESIDES HIS MEDICAL ONE BUT THE INTEREST OF THE COMMUNITY IS NOT ONLY A NEGATIVE ONE
1355-39947-0094 AND IF THE ABSURDITY OF SUCH A PROPOSAL IS RECOGNIZED IT SEEMS TO MANY JUSTIFIED TO DEMAND SUCH AN INTRUSION AT LEAST IN THE CASE OF THE BORN CRIMINAL EVEN IF THE OCCASIONAL CRIMINAL CANNOT BE REACHED
1363-135842-0003 ON HIS WAY THROUGH THE GREEN FOREST HE PASSED A CERTAIN TREE HE WAS JUST PAST AND NO MORE WHEN A FAMILIAR VOICE HAILED HIM
1363-135842-0010 MISTER OPOSSUM BUT PETER WASN'T LISTENING THE FACT IS PETER HAD STARTED LIPPERTY LIPPERTY LIP FOR SCHOOL WITHOUT EVEN BEING POLITE ENOUGH TO SAY GOOD BY HE ARRIVED AT SCHOOL QUITE OUT OF BREATH
1363-135842-0024 HE LOOKED A GREAT DEAL AS THOUGH HE MIGHT BE A GIANT RAT BUT IF UNC BILLY WAS A FUNNY LOOKING FELLOW OL MISSUS POSSUM WAS EVEN MORE FUNNY LOOKING
1363-135842-0031 THOSE CERTAINLY ARE HANDY TAILS HANDIEST TAILS EVER WAS DECLARED UNC BILLY
1363-135842-0038 IT IS A WONDER THAT BETWEEN YOU AND CHATTERER THE RED SQUIRREL ANY OF THE BIRDS SUCCEED IN RAISING FAMILIES AROUND HERE HAVE YOU VISITED FARMER BROWN'S HEN HOUSE LATELY UNC BILLY SHOOK HIS HEAD
1363-135842-0051 BUT NONE OF THEM CAN DO IT AS WELL AS UNC BILLY POSSUM PRETENDING TO BE DEAD IN ORDER TO REMAIN ALIVE IS THE CLEVEREST THING UNC BILLY DOES
1363-139304-0013 WHAT WAS THAT SOUND OF PATTERING FEET AND THAT RISE AND FALL LIKE THE MURMUR OF BREAKERS ON PEBBLES HE PUT OUT A LANGUID HAND TO REACH HIS WATCH FROM THE CHAIR WHEREON IT WAS HIS HABIT TO PLACE IT
1363-139304-0027 IT RANG BUT DID NOT BREAK AND SAT DOWN IN ONE OF THE ARMCHAIRS WHEN HE HAD A LITTLE RECOVERED HE FILLED THE REMAINING GLASS FROM THE BOTTLE AND DRANK A COLOURLESS LIQUID IT WAS BUT NOT WATER
1363-139304-0034 BOSCASTLE HE POURED OUT AND PARTIALLY DRANK ANOTHER GLASS OF THE COLOURLESS FLUID WHAT WAS THIS PLACE THIS PLACE THAT TO HIS SENSES SEEMED SUBTLY QUIVERING LIKE A THING ALIVE
1363-139304-0041 WERE THREE FIGURES RICHLY DRESSED IN LOOSE AND EASY GARMENTS OF BRIGHT SOFT COLOURINGS THE NOISE OF A GREAT MULTITUDE OF PEOPLE POURED UP OVER THE BALCONY AND ONCE IT SEEMED
1447-130550-0009 FATE HAD TURNED AND TWISTED A THOUSAND WAYS FED BY MANY CURRENTS FROM THE LONG STREAM OF HUMAN EXPERIENCE
1447-130550-0016 GENEROUS TO A PATHETIC AND TOUCHING DEGREE GIVE VENT TO HIS INDIGNATION GIVING AN EAR TO A LITTLE NEIGHBORLY GOSSIP
1447-130550-0023 HE POURED BITTER AND BITING RIDICULE ON HIS DISCOMFITED OPPONENTS HE SPOKE WITH SLEDGEHAMMER DIRECTNESS
1447-130551-0006 IN A KIND OF CONFUSED ASTONISHMENT IN A MOST COMMENDABLE FASHION IN A MOST IMPRESSIVE VEIN IN A POSITION OF UNDISPUTED SUPREMACY
1447-130551-0013 IN THE DIM PROCESSION OF YEARS IN THE HIGHEST CONCEIVABLE DEGREE IN THE LOCAL PHRASE IN THE NATURE OF THINGS
1447-130551-0020 INSTANTLY ALIVE TO THE SLIGHTEST BREACH OF DECORUM INSUFFERABLE VIOLENCE TO THE FEELINGS INTENSE AND STUBBORN DOGMATISM
1447-130551-0034 IT WOULD BE SUPERFLUOUS TO SAY IT WOULD NOT SEEM AN IMPROBABLE CONCLUSION
1447-130552-0006 BY A JEALOUS HATE MAINTAINED WITH INGENUITY AND VIGOR MANIFESTLY HARSH AND BARBAROUS MARVELOUS COPIOUSNESS OF ILLUSTRATION
1447-130552-0013 OBSESSED WITH AN OVERWEENING PRIDE OBSTACLES THAT ARE DIFFICULT BUT NOT INSUPERABLE OBVIOUSLY AT VARIANCE WITH FACTS
1447-130552-0027 PRINCELY GENEROSITY OF PRAISE PRODIGIOUS AND PORTENTOUS EVENTS PROTRACTED TO A VEXATIOUS LENGTH
1447-17506-0006 THE COUNT TWIRLED HIS SMALL AND SLENDER MOUSTACHES IN A WAY THAT PATSY THOUGHT AFFECTED AND SAID IN EXCELLENT ENGLISH
1447-17506-0013 BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING IN THE APPEARANCE OF THIS CALLOW ITALIAN NOBLEMAN THAT STAMPED HIS CHARACTER AS ARTIFICIAL AND INSINCERE HE RESOLVED TO FIND OUT SOMETHING ABOUT HIS ANTECEDENTS BEFORE HE PERMITTED THE YOUNG FELLOW
1447-17506-0027 WHEN AN IMPOSTURE IS UNMASKED IT IS NO LONGER DANGEROUS HE JOINED HIS NIECES WHO WERE ALL BUSILY ENGAGED IN WRITING LETTERS HOME AND REMARKED CASUALLY YOU'VE BEEN DECEIVED IN YOUR ITALIAN FRIEND LOUISE
1447-17506-0034 SAID LOUISE SLOWLY AS SHE RESUMED HER WRITING WELL THEN GIRLS WHAT DO YOU SAY TO A STROLL AROUND THE VILLAGE ASKED THEIR UNCLE I'M TOLD IT'S A PROPER PLACE TO BUY SILK STOCKINGS AND INLAID WOOD WORK THEY COME ASSORTED I SUPPOSE
1455-134435-0006 BUT FOR THE INFLUENCE OF HER HUSBAND AND THE RESPECT HE INSPIRED IN PEOPLE'S MINDS
1455-134435-0020 ON AND ON WENT HER VOICE IT WAS NOT
1455-134435-0027 DIFFERENT WITH HIM LOUISE TURNED AND WENT OUT OF THE ROOM LEAVING THE TWO MEN TO SIT IN EMBARRASSED SILENCE AS VERY OFTEN HAPPENED SHE LATER STAYED IN HER ROOM FOR DAYS
1455-134435-0034 THE EFFORT HE HAD MADE TO EXTEND HIS LAND HOLDINGS HAD BEEN SUCCESSFUL AND THERE WERE FEW FARMS IN THE VALLEY THAT DID NOT BELONG TO HIM BUT UNTIL DAVID CAME HE WAS A BITTERLY DISAPPOINTED MAN
1455-134435-0047 AND IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT GOD HAD AT LAST LOOKED WITH FAVOR UPON HIM AS FOR THE BOY ON THE FARM LIFE BEGAN TO REVEAL ITSELF TO HIM IN A THOUSAND NEW AND DELIGHTFUL WAYS THE KINDLY ATTITUDE OF ALL ABOUT HIM EXPANDED HIS QUIET NATURE
1455-134435-0054 WHEN HE HAD RUN THROUGH THE LONG OLD HOUSE SHUTTING THE DOORS BEHIND HIM WITH A BANG HE CAME INTO THE BARNYARD AND LOOKED ABOUT WITH AN AMAZED AIR OF EXPECTANCY
1455-134435-0061 AND AGAIN AS ON THAT NIGHT WHEN HE HAD RUN THROUGH THE FIELDS CRYING FOR A SON HE BECAME EXCITED TO THE EDGE OF INSANITY
1455-138263-0001 AND BARBICANE AND HIS TWO COMPANIONS WATCHED WITH SCRUPULOUS ATTENTION THE BRILLIANT RAYS WHICH THE CELEBRATED MOUNTAIN SHED SO CURIOUSLY OVER THE HORIZON WHAT WAS THIS RADIANT GLORY WHAT
1455-138263-0008 BY JOVE REPLIED MICHEL ARDAN
1455-138263-0015 TO INTENSE HEAT NATURE WAS THUS PREPARING THEM TO BECOME SELENITES BECOME SELENITES THAT IDEA BROUGHT UP ONCE MORE THE QUESTION OF THE HABITABILITY OF THE MOON AFTER WHAT THEY HAD SEEN COULD THE TRAVELERS SOLVE IT
1455-138263-0029 MY FRIENDS REPLIED BARBICANE I DID NOT UNDERTAKE THIS JOURNEY IN ORDER TO FORM AN OPINION ON THE PAST HABITABILITY OF OUR SATELLITE BUT I WILL ADD THAT OUR PERSONAL OBSERVATIONS ONLY CONFIRM ME IN THIS OPINION
1455-138263-0036 THAT IF IN THE ACTUAL STATE OF THE MOON ITS LONG NIGHTS AND LONG DAYS CREATED DIFFERENCES OF TEMPERATURE INSUPPORTABLE TO ORGANIZATION IT WAS NOT SO AT THE HISTORICAL PERIOD OF TIME THE ATMOSPHERE ENVELOPED THE DISC WITH A FLUID MANTLE
1455-138263-0043 EXCLAIMED MICHEL ARDAN THAT THE MOON DID NOT EXIST BEFORE THE EARTH THEIR IMAGINATIONS CARRIED THEM AWAY INTO AN INDEFINITE FIELD OF HYPOTHESIS BARBICANE SOUGHT TO RESTRAIN THEM
150-126107-0000 BUT AS SURE AS HE FOUND A PRINCESS HE FOUND SOME FAULT IN HER OF COURSE HE COULD NOT MARRY A MERE WOMAN HOWEVER BEAUTIFUL AND THERE WAS NO PRINCESS TO BE FOUND WORTHY OF HIM
150-126107-0007 HE FOUND THAT HE WAS APPROACHING THE OUTSKIRTS OF THIS FOREST FOR THE TREES HAD GOT SO THIN THAT HE COULD SEE THE SUNSET THROUGH THEM AND HE SOON CAME UPON A KIND OF HEATH NEXT HE CAME UPON SIGNS OF HUMAN NEIGHBOURHOOD
150-126107-0014 YOU NAUGHTY NAUGHTY NAUGHTY NAUGHTY MAN SHE CRIED NO ONE HAD EVER SUCCEEDED IN PUTTING HER INTO A PASSION BEFORE WHEN THE PRINCE SAW HER ASCEND HE THOUGHT HE MUST HAVE BEEN BEWITCHED
150-126107-0028 TO THINK I AM THE ONLY PERSON IN MY FATHER'S KINGDOM THAT CAN'T FALL HERE THE POOR PRINCESS LOOKED ALMOST SAD I SHALL BE MOST HAPPY TO FALL IN WITH YOU ANY TIME YOU LIKE SAID THE PRINCE DEVOTEDLY THANK YOU
150-126107-0035 AND MERELY WHISPERED AS HE GAVE HER THE PARTING LIFT DON'T TELL THE ONLY ANSWER THE PRINCESS RETURNED WAS A ROGUISH LOOK SHE WAS ALREADY A YARD ABOVE HIS HEAD THE LOOK SEEMED TO SAY NEVER FEAR IT IS TOO GOOD FUN TO SPOIL THAT WAY
150-126112-0001 SHE WAS SO TRANSPORTED THAT SHE JUMPED OFF THE BED FEEBLE AS SHE WAS AND DANCED ABOUT THE ROOM FOR JOY SHE DID NOT CARE WHO THE MAN WAS THAT WAS NOTHING TO HER THE HOLE WANTED STOPPING AND IF ONLY A MAN WOULD DO WHY TAKE ONE
150-126112-0015 REPLIED THE PRINCESS I THINK I WILL GO TO SLEEP AGAIN JUST GIVE ME A GLASS OF WINE AND A BISCUIT FIRST SAID THE PRINCE VERY HUMBLY WITH ALL MY HEART SAID THE PRINCESS AND GAPED AS SHE SAID IT
150-126112-0022 AND THE PRINCESS SAT AND LOOKED AT HIM SHE FED HIM NOW AND THEN THE NIGHT WORE ON THE WATERS ROSE AND ROSE THE MOON ROSE LIKEWISE HIGHER AND HIGHER
150-126112-0029 AND THAT MADE HER THINK THAT HE COULD NOT GET ANY BREATH SHE WAS FRANTIC SHE GOT HOLD OF HIM AND HELD HIS HEAD ABOVE THE WATER WHICH WAS POSSIBLE NOW HIS HANDS WERE NO LONGER ON THE HOLE BUT IT WAS OF NO USE FOR HE WAS PAST BREATHING
150-132655-0006 AND THEY SAW OTHER CADIS PASHAS AND EFFENDIS COMING TO SUPPLY THE PLACE OF THE EXILES AND AFTERWARDS EXILED IN THEIR TURN THEY SAW HEADS DECENTLY IMPALED FOR PRESENTATION TO THE SUBLIME PORTE
150-132655-0013 HA SAID PANGLOSS TO PAQUETTE PROVIDENCE HAS THEN BROUGHT YOU AMONGST US AGAIN MY POOR CHILD DO YOU KNOW THAT YOU COST ME THE TIP OF MY NOSE AN EYE AND AN EAR AS YOU MAY SEE WHAT A WORLD IS THIS
150-132655-0020 I PRESUME IN GENERAL THAT THEY WHO MEDDLE WITH THE ADMINISTRATION OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS DIE SOMETIMES MISERABLY AND THAT THEY DESERVE IT BUT I NEVER TROUBLE MY HEAD ABOUT WHAT IS TRANSACTING AT CONSTANTINOPLE
150-132655-0034 THERE IS A CONCATENATION OF EVENTS IN THIS BEST OF ALL POSSIBLE WORLDS
1502-122615-0005 AFTER THIS TERMINATION OF THE SCENE DUNCAN WANDERED AMONG THE LODGES UNQUESTIONED AND UNNOTICED ENDEAVORING TO FIND SOME TRACE OF HER IN WHOSE BEHALF HE INCURRED THE RISK HE RAN
1502-122615-0012 HE WOULD GREATLY HAVE PREFERRED SILENCE AND MEDITATION TO SPEECH WHEN A DISCOVERY OF HIS REAL CONDITION MIGHT PROVE SO INSTANTLY FATAL UNFORTUNATELY FOR THIS PRUDENT RESOLUTION HIS ENTERTAINERS APPEARED OTHERWISE DISPOSED
1502-122615-0025 AS THOUGH ALL HAD INHALED AN IMPURITY AT THE SAME INSTANT THE SMOKE WREATHED ABOVE THEIR HEADS IN LITTLE EDDIES
1502-122619-0000 BRIEF I PRAY FOR YOU FOR YOU SEE TIS A BUSY TIME WITH ME MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING THE TRIBE OR RATHER HALF TRIBE OF DELAWARES
1502-122619-0014 FORTIFIED BY THESE ASSURANCES THE DARK FIGURE LEFT THE BROW OF THE NATURAL ROCKY TERRACE
1502-122619-0021 LEAVING THE REST OF THE TRIBE DEVOURED BY A DESIRE TO UNDERSTAND THE REASONS OF SO UNUSUAL A VISIT AND YET NOT BETRAYING THE LEAST IMPATIENCE BY SIGN OR WORD DURING THE SHORT AND FRUGAL REPAST THAT FOLLOWED
1502-122619-0028 DOES MY PRISONER GIVE TROUBLE TO MY BROTHERS SHE IS WELCOME THE PATH BETWEEN THE HURONS AND THE DELAWARES IS SHORT AND IT IS OPEN LET HER BE SENT TO MY SQUAWS IF SHE GIVES TROUBLE TO MY BROTHER
1502-122619-0042 THE RED SKINS SHOULD BE FRIENDS AND LOOK WITH OPEN EYES ON THE WHITE MEN HAS NOT MY BROTHER SCENTED SPIES IN THE WOODS THE DELAWARE WHOSE NAME IN ENGLISH SIGNIFIED HARD HEART
1502-122619-0049 TOGETHER WITH A MATERIAL PART OF THEIR PHYSICAL FORCE WERE ACTUALLY WITHIN THE LIMITS OF THE FRENCH TERRITORY ACCORDINGLY THIS ALARMING ANNUNCIATION WAS RECEIVED AS MAGUA INTENDED
1502-122619-0056 A LONG AND MUSING PAUSE SUCCEEDED THE CHIEF CONSULTED APART WITH HIS COMPANIONS AND MESSENGERS DESPATCHED TO COLLECT CERTAIN OTHERS OF THE MOST DISTINGUISHED MEN OF THE TRIBE AS WARRIOR AFTER WARRIOR DROPPED IN
1502-122619-0070 STANDING READY TO MOVE HIS AUDITORS TO SOME HASTY AND PERHAPS INJUDICIOUS DISCUSSION
1502-122619-0077 HIS DARK WRINKLED COUNTENANCE WAS IN SINGULAR AND WILD CONTRAST WITH THE LONG WHITE LOCKS WHICH FLOATED ON HIS SHOULDERS
1502-122619-0084 WAS WHISPERED FROM MOUTH TO MOUTH MAGUA HAD OFTEN HEARD THE FAME OF THIS WISE AND JUST DELAWARE
1553-140047-0001 WHICH HAD BEEN BORN AND REARED IN A STATE OF ADVENTUROUS POVERTY AND PERILOUS UNCERTAINTY RIVERBORO WAS DOING ITS BEST TO RETURN THE ENTIRE TRIBE OF SIMPSONS TO THE LAND OF ITS FATHERS SO TO SPEAK
1553-140047-0008 IF THESE VILLAGES COULD BE INDUCED TO BUY THE EXCELSIOR SOAP COMPANY PAID A VERY SMALL RETURN OF ANY KIND TO ITS INFANTILE AGENTS WHO WERE SCATTERED THROUGH THE STATE BUT IT INFLAMED THEIR IMAGINATIONS BY THE ISSUE OF CIRCULARS
1553-140047-0015 BUT A NOTE IN THE MARGIN OF THE CIRCULAR INFORMED THEM THAT IT STOOD TWO AND A HALF FEET HIGH WHEN SET UP IN ALL ITS DIGNITY AND SPLENDOR ON A PROPER TABLE THREE DOLLARS EXTRA IT WAS ONLY OF POLISHED BRASS CONTINUED THE CIRCULAR
1553-140047-0029 AND LET ELIJAH OR ELISHA TRY THE SOAP BEFORE WE BEGIN SELLING I CAN'T IMAGINE A BABE DOING A FAMILY WASH WITH ANY SOAP ANSWERED REBECCA BUT IT MUST BE TRUE OR THEY WOULD NEVER DARE TO PRINT IT SO DON'T LET'S BOTHER
1553-140047-0036 BUT WHEN FULLY PERSUADED THAT THE ENTERPRISE WAS A CHARITABLE ONE SHE ACQUIESCED THE GIRLS CALLED AT MISTER WATSON'S STORE AND ARRANGED FOR SEVERAL LARGE BOXES OF SOAP TO BE CHARGED TO CLARA BELLE SIMPSON'S ACCOUNT

1578-140045-0024 WE COULDN'T KEEP FROM LAUGHING AFTER WE CAME OUT OF THE TENT BECAUSE THEY WERE ACTING ON SUCH A SMALL PLATFORM THAT ELIZA HAD TO RUN ROUND AND ROUND

1578-140049-0022 ON IT STOOD THE SACRED THE ADORED THE LONG DESIRED OBJECT ALMOST AS BEAUTIFUL AND NEARLY HALF AS LARGE AS THE ADVERTISEMENT THE BRASS GLISTENED LIKE GOLD AND THE CRIMSON PAPER SHADE GLOWED LIKE A GIANT RUBY

1624-142933-0000 PETER SEES ROSEBREAST AND FINDS REDCOAT
1624-142933-0014 IF THERE IS ANY ONE THING I CAN'T STAND IT IS BEING LAUGHED AT I WASN'T LAUGHING AT YOU REPLIED PETER VERY MEEKLY I WAS JUST LAUGHING AT THE THOUGHT OF HOW FUNNY YOU WOULD LOOK WITH A PAIR OF LONG EARS LIKE MINE
1624-142933-0021 WHILE ROSEBREAST SANG MISSUS GROSBEAK WAS VERY BUSILY PICKING BUDS AND BLOSSOMS FROM THE TREE WHAT IS SHE DOING THAT FOR INQUIRED PETER FOR THE SAME REASON THAT YOU BITE OFF SWEET CLOVER BLOSSOMS AND LEAVES
1624-142933-0028 NEVER BEFORE HAD HE SEEN REDCOAT SO CLOSE AT HAND THEN QUITE SUDDENLY IT CAME OVER PETER THAT SOMETHING WAS WRONG WITH REDCOAT AND HE HURRIED FORWARD TO SEE WHAT THE TROUBLE MIGHT BE REDCOAT HEARD THE RUSTLE OF PETER'S FEET AMONG THE DRY LEAVES
1624-142933-0042 CONTINUED FARMER BROWN'S BOY STROKING REDCOAT EVER SO GENTLY SOMEHOW AT THAT GENTLE TOUCH REDCOAT LOST MUCH OF HIS FEAR AND A LITTLE HOPE SPRANG IN HIS HEART
1624-168623-0002 ENORMOUS AND AGILE SHE BELONGED AS WE HAVE SAID TO THE RACE OF THOSE COLOSSAL WILD WOMEN WHO CONTORT THEMSELVES AT FAIRS WITH PAVING STONES HANGING FROM THEIR HAIR SHE DID EVERYTHING ABOUT THE HOUSE
1624-168623-0009 HE GREATLY RESEMBLED THE PORTRAITS OF THE ABBE DELILLE HIS COQUETRY CONSISTED IN DRINKING WITH THE CARTERS NO ONE HAD EVER SUCCEEDED IN RENDERING HIM DRUNK HE SMOKED A BIG PIPE
1624-168623-0023 THIS GIANTESS WAS JEALOUS IT SEEMED TO HER THAT THAT THIN AND YELLOW LITTLE MAN MUST BE AN OBJECT COVETED BY ALL THENARDIER WHO WAS ABOVE ALL AN ASTUTE AND WELL BALANCED MAN WAS A SCAMP OF A TEMPERATE SORT
1624-168623-0030 SHE WORKED HE CREATED HE DIRECTED EVERYTHING BY A SORT OF INVISIBLE AND CONSTANT MAGNETIC ACTION A WORD WAS SUFFICIENT FOR HIM SOMETIMES A SIGN THE MASTODON OBEYED
1624-168623-0037 A THEATRE WORTHY OF THIS GREAT TALENT WAS LACKING
1624-168623-0051 A FIERCE MISTRESS AND VENOMOUS MASTER THE THENARDIER HOSTELRY WAS LIKE A SPIDER'S WEB IN WHICH COSETTE HAD BEEN CAUGHT AND WHERE SHE LAY TREMBLING THE IDEAL OF OPPRESSION WAS REALIZED BY THIS SINISTER HOUSEHOLD
163-121908-0004 OUR GOOD ARISTOTLE SAYS SHE HAS DEFINED IT CONCISELY IN HIS PHYSICS AND CLOSELY IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TRUTH HOW PRAY SAID I
163-121908-0011 SOON TO DRAW APART AND PLAINWARD EACH ITS SEPARATE WAY TO WEND WHEN ONCE MORE THEIR WATERS MINGLE IN A CHANNEL
163-122947-0012 MORAL SERMONS AND GOODY GOODNESS WON'T CHIME
163-122947-0019 IT IS ALSO A KIND OF INDEMNITY FOR THEIR BEING BADLY ENDOWED BY NATURE AND FINALLY IT IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR ACQUIRING SPIRIT AND BECOMING SUBTLE
163-122947-0026 NOTWITHSTANDING HE PERCEIVE DEVOTION TO THESE INTERESTS HE CALLS IT DESINTERESSE AND WONDERS HOW IT IS POSSIBLE TO ACT DISINTERESTEDLY THERE HAVE BEEN PHILOSOPHERS
163-122947-0040 THE HYBRID EUROPEAN A TOLERABLY UGLY PLEBEIAN TAKEN ALL IN ALL ABSOLUTELY REQUIRES A COSTUME HE NEEDS HISTORY AS A STOREROOM OF COSTUMES
163-122947-0047 PROBABLY AS PARODISTS OF THE WORLD'S HISTORY AND AS GOD'S MERRY ANDREWS PERHAPS THOUGH NOTHING ELSE OF THE PRESENT HAVE A FUTURE OUR LAUGHTER ITSELF MAY HAVE A FUTURE
163-122947-0054 THE HISTORICAL SENSE IMPLIES ALMOST THE SENSE AND INSTINCT FOR EVERYTHING THE TASTE AND TONGUE FOR EVERYTHING WHEREBY IT IMMEDIATELY PROVES ITSELF TO BE AN IGNOBLE SENSE FOR INSTANCE
163-122947-0068 WHETHER IT BE HEDONISM PESSIMISM UTILITARIANISM OR EUDAEMONISM ALL THOSE MODES OF THINKING WHICH MEASURE THE WORTH OF THINGS ACCORDING TO PLEASURE AND PAIN
163-122947-0075 THE SCULPTOR THE HARDNESS OF THE HAMMER THE DIVINITY OF THE SPECTATOR AND THE SEVENTH DAY DO YE UNDERSTAND THIS CONTRAST AND THAT YOUR SYMPATHY FOR THE CREATURE IN MAN
163-122947-0082 THESE ARE MEN WITHOUT DUTY WE HAVE ALWAYS FOOLS AND APPEARANCES AGAINST US
163-122947-0095 IS NOT A MORALIST THE OPPOSITE OF A PURITAN THAT IS TO SAY AS A THINKER WHO REGARDS MORALITY AS QUESTIONABLE AS WORTHY OF INTERROGATION IN SHORT AS A PROBLEM
1723-141149-0003 A GROUP OF FUEGIANS PARTLY CONCEALED BY THE ENTANGLED FOREST WERE PERCHED ON A WILD POINT OVERHANGING THE SEA AND AS WE PASSED BY THEY SPRANG UP AND WAVING THEIR TATTERED CLOAKS SENT FORTH A LOUD AND SONOROUS SHOUT THE SAVAGES FOLLOWED THE SHIP
1723-141149-0010 AND THEY SEEM CLOSELY ALLIED TO THE FAMOUS PATAGONIANS OF THE STRAIT OF MAGELLAN THEIR ONLY GARMENT CONSISTS OF A MANTLE MADE OF GUANACO SKIN WITH THE WOOL OUTSIDE THIS THEY WEAR JUST THROWN OVER THEIR SHOULDERS LEAVING THEIR PERSONS AS OFTEN EXPOSED AS COVERED
1723-141149-0024 AND SOME OF THESE NATIVES AS WELL AS A CHILD WHOM HE BOUGHT FOR A PEARL BUTTON HE TOOK WITH HIM TO ENGLAND DETERMINING TO EDUCATE THEM AND INSTRUCT THEM IN RELIGION AT HIS OWN EXPENSE TO SETTLE THESE NATIVES IN THEIR OWN COUNTRY
1723-141149-0031 POOR POOR FELLOW HE WAS OF A PATRIOTIC DISPOSITION AND HE LIKED TO PRAISE HIS OWN TRIBE AND COUNTRY
1723-141149-0038 AND HENCE IT WAS GENERALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND OUT BY CROSS QUESTIONING WHETHER ONE HAD RIGHTLY UNDERSTOOD ANYTHING WHICH THEY HAD ASSERTED THEIR SIGHT WAS REMARKABLY ACUTE IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT SAILORS FROM LONG PRACTICE CAN MAKE OUT A DISTANT OBJECT MUCH BETTER THAN A LANDSMAN
1723-141149-0052 WERE DECAYED TO THE HEART AND READY TO FALL THE ENTANGLED MASS OF THE THRIVING AND THE FALLEN REMINDED ME OF THE FORESTS WITHIN THE TROPICS YET THERE WAS A DIFFERENCE FOR IN THESE STILL SOLITUDES DEATH INSTEAD OF LIFE SEEMED THE PREDOMINANT SPIRIT
1723-141149-0059 THEY WERE AS THICK TOGETHER AS BOX IN THE BORDER OF A GARDEN AND WE WERE OBLIGED TO STRUGGLE OVER THE FLAT BUT TREACHEROUS SURFACE
1723-141149-0066 AND WE ENJOYED A FINE VIEW OF THE SURROUNDING ISLES CAPE HORN HOWEVER DEMANDED HIS TRIBUTE AND BEFORE NIGHT SENT US A GALE OF WIND DIRECTLY IN OUR TEETH WE STOOD OUT TO SEA AND ON THE SECOND DAY AGAIN MADE THE LAND
1723-141149-0080 WHICH IS BARELY SUFFICIENT TO COVER THEIR BACKS AS LOW DOWN AS THEIR LOINS IT IS LACED ACROSS THE BREAST BY STRINGS AND ACCORDING AS THE WIND BLOWS IT IS SHIFTED FROM SIDE TO SIDE BUT THESE FUEGIANS IN THE CANOE WERE QUITE NAKED AND EVEN ONE FULL GROWN WOMAN WAS ABSOLUTELY SO
1723-141149-0087 A SUCCESSION OF GALES PREVENTED THE WOMEN FROM GETTING SHELL FISH ON THE ROCKS AND THEY COULD NOT GO OUT IN THEIR CANOES TO CATCH SEAL A SMALL PARTY OF THESE MEN ONE MORNING SET OUT AND THE OTHER INDIANS EXPLAINED TO HIM THAT THEY WERE GOING A FOUR DAYS JOURNEY FOR FOOD
1723-141149-0094 AND SOMETIMES IN THE MOUNTAIN FORESTS WE DO NOT KNOW WHAT CEREMONIES THEY PERFORM JEMMY BUTTON WOULD NOT EAT LAND BIRDS BECAUSE EAT DEAD MEN THEY ARE UNWILLING EVEN TO MENTION THEIR DEAD FRIENDS WE HAVE NO REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THEY PERFORM ANY SORT OF RELIGIOUS WORSHIP
1723-141149-0108 THE CANOE THEIR MOST INGENIOUS WORK POOR AS IT IS HAS REMAINED THE SAME AS WE KNOW FROM DRAKE FOR THE LAST TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS WHILST BEHOLDING THESE SAVAGES ONE ASKS WHENCE HAVE THEY COME WHAT COULD HAVE TEMPTED
1737-142396-0003 THEY WERE FREE TO ISSUE FORTH AND BUY GUNPOWDER IN THE FULL EYE OF THE SUN FREE TO FIRE CANNONS AND EXPLODE MINES ON THE LAWN YET THEY NEVER DID ANY ONE OF THESE THINGS NO IRRESISTIBLE ENERGY HALED THEM TO CHURCH O SUNDAYS
1737-142396-0010 THEN TOO HE WAS ALWAYS READY TO CONSTITUTE HIMSELF A HOSTILE ARMY OR A BAND OF MARAUDING INDIANS ON THE SHORTEST POSSIBLE NOTICE IN BRIEF A DISTINCTLY ABLE MAN WITH TALENTS SO FAR AS WE COULD JUDGE IMMENSELY ABOVE THE MAJORITY
1737-142397-0000 THE MASTERFUL WIND WAS UP AND OUT SHOUTING AND CHASING THE LORD OF THE MORNING POPLARS SWAYED AND TOSSED WITH A ROARING SWISH DEAD LEAVES SPRANG ALOFT AND WHIRLED INTO SPACE AND ALL THE CLEAR SWEPT HEAVEN SEEMED TO THRILL WITH SOUND LIKE A GREAT HARP
1737-142397-0007 AND OFFERING PHANTOM MUFFINS TO INVISIBLE WAYFARERS
1737-142397-0014 AND I'LL RUN ON TO THAT CORNER AND BE A LION
1737-142397-0028 AND IT WAS WITH A CERTAIN SURPRISE THAT I FOUND MYSELF REGARDING THESE FATUOUS ONES WITH KINDLINESS INSTEAD OF CONTEMPT AS I RAMBLED BY UNHEEDED OF THEM THERE WAS INDEED SOME RECONCILING INFLUENCE ABROAD WHICH COULD BRING THE LIKE ANTICS INTO HARMONY WITH BUD AND GROWTH AND THE FROLIC AIR
1737-142397-0035 A SORRY SIGHT FOR ONE THAT HAD KNOWN THE FELLOW IN MORE BUSTLING CIRCUMSTANCES NATURE MIGHT AT LEAST HAVE PAUSED TO SHED ONE TEAR OVER THIS ROUGH JACKETED LITTLE SON OF HERS FOR HIS WASTED AIMS HIS CANCELLED AMBITIONS HIS WHOLE CAREER OF USEFULNESS CUT SUDDENLY SHORT BUT NOT A BIT OF IT
1737-142397-0042 BY THE BACK DOOR HE HAD RENDERED UP HIS DUCKWEED BEDABBLED PERSON INTO THE HANDS OF AN AUNT AND HAD BEEN PROMPTLY SENT OFF TO BED AND THIS ON A HOLIDAY WAS VERY MUCH
1737-146161-0013 KNIT SEVEN MAKE ONE KNIT TWO TOGETHER
1737-148989-0002 AND LET US BEAR IT TOGETHER EMIL'S SHIP IS LOST AND AS YET NO NEWS OF HIM IT WAS WELL MISTER BHAER HAD TAKEN HIS WIFE INTO HIS STRONG ARMS FOR SHE LOOKED READY TO DROP BUT BORE UP AFTER A MOMENT
1737-148989-0009 HAD THEY ALL BEEN TRUE THE ELDERS BORE IT QUIETLY HAVING LEARNED SUBMISSION IN LIFE'S HARD SCHOOL BUT THE YOUNGER PEOPLE REBELLED SOME HOPED AGAINST HOPE AND KEPT UP OTHERS DESPAIRED AT ONCE AND LITTLE JOSIE EMIL'S PET COUSIN AND PLAYMATE WAS SO BROKEN HEARTED
1737-148989-0022 THOUGH EMIL WHO WAS TO ACCOMPANY THEM WOULD BE THE GREATER HERO LITTLE DID THE DEAR SOULS DREAM WHAT A SURPRISE WAS IN STORE FOR THEM AS THEY INNOCENTLY LAID THEIR PLANS AND WISHED ALL THE BOYS COULD BE THERE TO WELCOME HOME THEIR ELDEST AND THEIR CASABLANCA
1737-148989-0036 HE HAD FOUND THE LITTLE GUIDE BOOK THAT CHRISTIAN CARRIED IN HIS BOSOM AND LOVE PENITENCE AND PRAYER THE THREE SWEET SISTERS HAD GIVEN HIM THE ARMOUR WHICH WOULD KEEP HIM SAFE HE HAD NOT LEARNED TO WEAR IT YET AND CHAFED AGAINST IT THOUGH HE FELT ITS VALUE
1743-142912-0009 ALL THE OTHER BIRDS JOINED HIM IN CALLING REDTAIL BAD NAMES BUT NONE NOT EVEN BULLY THE ENGLISH SPARROW WAS BRAVE ENOUGH TO JOIN HIM IN ATTACKING BIG REDTAIL WHEN HE HAD SUCCEEDED IN DRIVING REDTAIL FAR ENOUGH FROM THE OLD ORCHARD TO SUIT HIM
1743-142912-0016 THOSE THAT I DO CATCH ARE MOSTLY DRONES AND YOU KNOW THE DRONES ARE USELESS THEY DO NO WORK AT ALL IT IS ONLY BY ACCIDENT THAT I NOW AND THEN CATCH A WORKER I EAT ALL KINDS OF INSECTS THAT FLY AND SOME THAT DON'T
1743-142912-0023 EVERY WAY BUT THE RIGHT WAY LOOK UP OVER YOUR HEAD CRIED THE VOICE RATHER A HARSH VOICE
1743-142913-0000 WITH THIS JENNY WREN DISAPPEARED INSIDE HER HOUSE AND THERE WAS NOTHING FOR PETER TO DO BUT ONCE MORE START FOR THE DEAR OLD BRIAR PATCH ON HIS WAY HE COULDN'T RESIST THE TEMPTATION TO RUN OVER TO THE GREEN FOREST WHICH WAS JUST BEYOND THE OLD ORCHARD
1743-142913-0007 BUT NO ONE COULD EVER MISTAKE PEWEE FOR ANY OF HIS RELATIVES FOR THE SIMPLE REASON THAT HE KEEPS REPEATING HIS OWN NAME OVER AND OVER AREN'T YOU HERE EARLY ASKED PETER PEWEE NODDED
1743-142913-0014 JENNY WREN WAS AS GOOD AS HER WORD WHILE SHE FLITTED AND HOPPED ABOUT THIS WAY AND THAT WAY IN THAT FUSSY WAY OF HERS GETTING HER BREAKFAST SHE TALKED JENNY COULDN'T KEEP HER TONGUE STILL IF SHE WANTED TO DID YOU FIND ANY OLD CLOTHES OF THE SNAKE FAMILY SHE DEMANDED
1743-142913-0028 SPOOKY ISN'T PARTICULAR SO LONG AS THE HOUSE IS BIG ENOUGH TO BE COMFORTABLE HE LIVES IN IT MORE OR LESS THE YEAR AROUND NOW I MUST GET BACK TO THOSE EGGS OF MINE I'VE TALKED QUITE ENOUGH FOR ONE MORNING OH JENNY CRIED PETER AS A SUDDEN THOUGHT STRUCK HIM
1743-142914-0004 FROM RIGHT UNDER HIS VERY NOSE SOMETHING SHOT UP INTO THE AIR WITH A WHISTLING SOUND IT STARTLED PETER SO THAT HE STOPPED SHORT WITH HIS EYES POPPING OUT OF HIS HEAD
1743-142914-0011 LONGBILL TOOK TWO OR THREE STEPS IN RATHER A STATELY FASHION PETER HAD TO HIDE A SMILE FOR LONGBILL HAD SUCH AN AIR OF IMPORTANCE YET AT THE SAME TIME WAS SUCH AN ODD LOOKING FELLOW
1743-142914-0025 NOW I MUST BE RUNNING ALONG I'M EVER SO GLAD TO HAVE SEEN YOU AND I'M COMING OVER TO CALL AGAIN THE FIRST CHANCE I GET SO PETER SAID GOOD BY AND KEPT ON DOWN THE LAUGHING BROOK TO THE SMILING POOL RIGHT WHERE THE LAUGHING BROOK ENTERED THE SMILING POOL
1743-142914-0032 THEY LOOKED SO MUCH LIKE THE SURROUNDING PEBBLES THAT HE NEVER WOULD HAVE SEEN THEM IN THE WORLD BUT FOR MISSUS TEETER PETER HASTILY BACKED AWAY A FEW STEPS MISSUS TEETER SLIPPED BACK ON THE EGGS AND SETTLED HERSELF COMFORTABLY
1841-150351-0004 WOULD BE THE MOST ADVANCED IN CIVILIZATION BUT SUCH WAS NOT THE CASE MANY OF THEM WERE AMONG THE MOST DEGRADED UPON THE CONTINENT THEY SEEMED UNABLE TO ADAPT THEMSELVES TO THE WHITE MAN AND HIS WAYS
1841-150351-0018 BERRIES ARE ABUNDANT DURING THE SUMMER AND ARE ALSO MUCH USED FOR FOOD THE CLOTHING OF THE INDIANS WAS ORIGINALLY A SORT OF BLANKET MADE OF THE WOVEN FIBRES OF CEDAR BARK OR MORE RARELY OF THE SKINS OF ANIMALS
1841-150351-0025 THE FRONTS OF THE HOUSES ARE ORNAMENTED WITH FIGURES HEWN OUT OF WOOD THESE REPRESENT MEN BIRDS AND ANIMALS AND HAVE A RELIGIOUS SIGNIFICANCE SOMETIMES THESE FIGURES ARE MOUNTED UPON THE TOPS OF TALL POLES
1841-150351-0032 BUT IT HAS PROBABLY BEEN SEVERAL THOUSAND YEARS SOME OF THE MAIN GROUPS HAVE UNDOUBTEDLY BEEN HERE LONGER THAN OTHERS
1841-159771-0013 IT SEEMED AS IF THERE WASN'T ANYTHING TO EAT ANYWHERE EXCEPT AT THE FARM BUILDINGS WHICH FARMER GREEN HAD STUFFED FULL OF HAY AND GRAIN DURING THE SUMMER AND AUTUMN MANY OF THE FOREST FOLK STOLE DOWN FROM BLUE MOUNTAIN AFTER NIGHTFALL
1841-159771-0020 IN THE ORCHARD HIS COUSIN CRIED AND THEN HE HURRIED AWAY AGAIN I WISH HE'D WAIT A MINUTE MASTER MEADOW MOUSE GRUMBLED AS HE TORE AFTER HIS COUSIN ONCE MORE
1841-159771-0027 BUT FARMER GREEN DIDN'T AGREE WITH HIM WHEN HE HAPPENED TO GO INTO THE ORCHARD ONE DAY LATER AND SAW TREE AFTER TREE RUINED HE WAS VERY VERY MUCH DISPLEASED
1841-159771-0041 OH I WON'T BOTHER TO LOOK FOR PETER MINK TO DAY HE MUST BE MILES AWAY I'LL STEP RIGHT OUT OF MY TUNNEL AND HAVE MY SWIM WITHOUT TAKING A LOOK SEE FIRST BUT MASTER MEADOW MOUSE WAS NEVER SO LAZY AS THAT
1841-179183-0005 AND THAT THERE IS MORE MEANT IN THINGS THAN MEETS THE EYE MY HAND IS TO ME WHAT YOUR HEARING AND SIGHT TOGETHER ARE TO YOU IN LARGE MEASURE WE TRAVEL THE SAME HIGHWAYS READ THE SAME BOOKS SPEAK THE SAME LANGUAGE
1841-179183-0012 THE COOLNESS OF A WATER LILY ROUNDING INTO BLOOM IS DIFFERENT FROM THE COOLNESS OF AN EVENING WIND IN SUMMER AND DIFFERENT AGAIN FROM THE COOLNESS OF THE RAIN THAT SOAKS INTO THE HEARTS OF GROWING THINGS AND GIVES THEM LIFE AND BODY
1841-179183-0025 CARVINGS ON THE WALL OR A CURIOUS ARCHITECTURAL FEATURE EXHIBITED LIKE THE FAMILY ALBUM THEREFORE A HOUSE WITH WHICH I AM NOT FAMILIAR HAS FOR ME AT FIRST NO GENERAL EFFECT OR HARMONY OF DETAIL
1841-179183-0032 ITS FLOWING CURVES AND BENDINGS ARE A REAL PLEASURE ONLY BREATH IS WANTING BUT UNDER THE SPELL OF THE IMAGINATION THE MARBLE THRILLS AND BECOMES THE DIVINE REALITY OF THE IDEAL IMAGINATION PUTS A SENTIMENT INTO EVERY LINE AND CURVE
1867-148436-0000 CHAPTER TWELVE THE FIRST DAY MILE AFTER MILE OF THE ROUGH TRAIL FELL BEHIND HIM AND STILL THE PONY SHAMBLED ALONG AT A LOOSE TROT OR A SWINGING CANTER THE STEEP UPGRADES IT TOOK AT A STEADY JOG
1867-148436-0014 HELLO YOUNG FELLER LO STRANGER WHAT'S THE CHANCE OF BUNKING HERE FOR THREE OR FOUR HOURS AND GETTIN A GOOD FEED FOR THE HOSS NEVER BETTER GIMME THE HOSS
1867-148436-0021 I WAS JUST THINKIN OF PA WHAT'S HE SORE ABOUT COME OUT SHORT AT POKER LATELY NO HE LOST A HOSS HA HA HA HE EXPLAINED
1867-148436-0028 IT'S THE BEST HOSS I'VE EVER HAD IT WAS THE BEST HORSE PA EVER HAD TOO IT WAS A PIEBALD PINTO CALLED JO AFTER MY COUSIN JOSIAH WHO'S JEST A PLAIN BAD UN AND RAISES HELL WHEN THERE'S ANY EXCUSE THE PIEBALD
1867-148436-0042 AND HIS LIPS TWISTIN BACK THE SAME SMILE HE HAD WHEN HE GOT INTO THE SADDLE BUT PRETTY SOON I S'POSE JO HAD A CHANCE TO FIGURE OUT THAT IT DIDN'T DO HIM NO PARTICULAR HARM TO BE ALONE THE MINUTE HE SEEN THAT HE STOPPED FIGHTIN
1867-154071-0003 BILL GREGG SHOOK HIS HEAD THAT'S NOT THE ONE SHE'S ALL DIFFERENT A PILE DIFFERENT RONICKY RONICKY SIGHED
1867-154071-0010 ONE WEEK WAS DECIDED ON AS A FAIR TEST IF AT THE END OF THAT TIME CAROLINE SMITH DID NOT COME OUT OF THE HOUSE ACROSS THE STREET THEY COULD CONCLUDE THAT SHE DID NOT STAY THERE
1867-154071-0024 AS FOR BILL GREGG HE BORE HIMSELF STRAIGHT AS A SOLDIER AND CAME BACK ACROSS THE PAVEMENT BUT IT WAS THE ERECTNESS OF A SOLDIER WHO HAS MET WITH A CRUSHING DEFEAT AND ONLY PRESERVES AN OUTWARD RESOLUTION WHILE ALL THE SPIRIT WITHIN IS CRUSHED
1867-154071-0031 SAID RONICKY DOONE BILL LOOK ME IN THE EYE AND TELL ME MAN TO MAN THAT YOU'RE A LIAR HE ADDED CAN YOU EVER BE HAPPY WITHOUT HER MAN THE CRUELTY OF THAT SPEECH MADE GREGG FLUSH
1867-154071-0038 THE GENT THAT WAS WRITING THOSE PAPERS TO THE CORRESPONDENCE SCHOOL TO YOU FROM THE WEST THE ONE YOU SENT YOUR PICTURE TO AND SENT MY PICTURE TO SHE SAYS AND LOOKS AS IF THE GROUND HAD OPENED UNDER HER FEET YOU'RE MAD SHE SAYS
1867-154075-0007 THE MAN GROWLED SOME RETORT AND LEFT CLOSING THE DOOR HEAVILY BEHIND HIM WHILE RONICKY DOONE BREATHED FREELY AGAIN FOR THE FIRST TIME NOW SAID THE MAN OF THE SNEER TELL ME THE WHOLE OF IT RUTH RONICKY SET HIS TEETH
1867-154075-0014 YOU SHOW HIM THAT IT IS POSSIBLE
1867-154075-0021 THOUGH I WASN'T PLAYING MY HAND AT EAVESDROPPING I COULDN'T HELP HEARING YOU PARTNER THE MAN OF THE SNEER LOOKED HIM OVER LEISURELY WESTERN HE SAID AT LAST DECIDEDLY WESTERN ARE YOU STAYING LONG IN THE EAST MY FRIEND
1867-154075-0035 THIS CAROLINE SMITH MAY BE A PERSON OF GREAT VALUE TO ME I HAVE NO DOUBT SHE IS BUT I GOT A GOOD ARGUMENT
1867-154075-0042 AT THE SAME TIME A FLUSH OF EXCITEMENT AND FIERCENESS PASSED OVER THE FACE OF JOHN MARK RONICKY DOONE TAKEN UTTERLY BY SURPRISE WAS AT A GREAT DISADVANTAGE
1898-145702-0003 WHAT USE WAS IT OUR DESERTING WE MUST PERISH HERE MISERABLY WHILST THEY WERE SPEAKING A FIERY DRAGON CAME FLYING THROUGH THE AIR
1898-145702-0017 THEN SAID THE FIRST SOLDIER
1898-145715-0004 SHE FELT A LITTLE REASSURED AND WAS FURTHER CHEERED WHEN SHE DISCOVERED THAT HER PET CAT AND DOG HAD FOLLOWED HER
1898-145715-0011 HAD REVENGED HERSELF BY DEPRIVING HIM OF HIS NATURAL SHAPE FOR SOME YEARS THAT SHE HAD IMPRISONED HIM IN THE PALACE WHERE HE HAD FOUND HIS CONFINEMENT HARD TO BEAR FOR SOME TIME BUT NOW HE OWNED
1898-145715-0025 IT WAS THE ONLY CHANCE OF SEEING HER LOVER BEFORE THEY WERE SEPARATED AND SHE DID NOT HESITATE TO BREAK THE BOTTLE AND POUR THEIR CONTENTS INTO THE BASIN WHEN THE RAINBOW APPEARED AT ONCE THEIR FAREWELLS WERE FULL OF TENDERNESS
1898-145715-0032 BUT NO SOONER HAD LAGREE BEEN PUT TO FIGHT THAN OUR HEROINE WAS OVERWHELMED WITH HUNGER AND THIRST SHE FELT AS THOUGH SHE SHOULD CERTAINLY EXPIRE AND IT WAS WITH SOME DIFFICULTY THAT SHE DRAGGED HERSELF AS FAR
1898-145715-0039 FAIRER THAN A FAIRY FELT A STRONG DESIRE TO ENTER THIS CASTLE BUT BESIDES BEING HUNG A LITTLE ABOVE THE GROUND THERE SEEMED TO BE NEITHER DOORS NOR WINDOWS SHE HAD NO DOUBT THOUGH REALLY I CANNOT THINK WHY
1898-145720-0001 MANY OF THE YOUNG BRAVES SOUGHT HER IN MARRIAGE BUT SHE WOULD LISTEN TO ONE ONLY A HANDSOME CHIEF WHO HAD TAKEN HER FANCY SOME YEARS BEFORE SO THEY WERE TO BE MARRIED AND GREAT REJOICINGS WERE MADE
1898-145720-0015 ONLY THE CHILDREN HAD NO FEAR AND REACHED THE OTHER SIDE IN SAFETY STILL THOUGH THE CHIEF AND THE YOUNG GIRL QUAILED IN TERROR AT THESE HORRIBLE SIGHTS AND SOUNDS NO HARM CAME TO THEM FOR THEIR LIVES HAD BEEN FREE FROM EVIL
1898-145724-0010 THE PRINCE THANKED HIM FOR HIS INFORMATION AND CONTINUED HIS JOURNEY FOR A WHOLE YEAR ALONG THE SAME ROAD AND AT THE END OF IT CAME TO THE LITTLE HUT WHERE HE FOUND A VERY OLD MAN
1898-145724-0017 VERY WELL
1898-145724-0024 SHE GAVE HIM AT THE SAME TIME A CLOAK MADE OF COPPER
19-198-0000 NORTHANGER ABBEY
19-198-0007 WHERE THERE ARE HEADS AND ARMS AND LEGS ENOUGH FOR THE NUMBER BUT THE MORLANDS HAD LITTLE OTHER RIGHT TO THE WORD FOR THEY WERE IN GENERAL VERY PLAIN AND CATHERINE FOR MANY YEARS OF HER LIFE AS PLAIN AS ANY
19-198-0014 SHE LEARNT THE FABLE OF THE HARE AND MANY FRIENDS AS QUICKLY AS ANY GIRL IN ENGLAND HER MOTHER WISHED HER TO LEARN MUSIC AND CATHERINE WAS SURE SHE SHOULD LIKE IT FOR SHE WAS VERY FOND OF TINKLING THE KEYS OF THE OLD FORLORN SPINNET
19-198-0028 LIKE PATIENCE ON A MONUMENT SMILING AT GRIEF SO FAR HER IMPROVEMENT WAS SUFFICIENT AND IN MANY OTHER POINTS SHE CAME ON EXCEEDINGLY WELL FOR THOUGH SHE COULD NOT WRITE SONNETS
19-198-0035 BUT WHEN A YOUNG LADY IS TO BE A HEROINE THE PERVERSENESS OF FORTY SURROUNDING FAMILIES CANNOT PREVENT HER SOMETHING MUST AND WILL HAPPEN TO THROW A HERO IN HER WAY MISTER ALLEN
19-227-0004 MY DEAR CATHERINE I AM AFRAID YOU ARE GROWING QUITE A FINE LADY I DO NOT KNOW WHEN POOR RICHARD'S CRAVATS WOULD BE DONE IF HE HAD NO FRIEND BUT YOU YOUR HEAD RUNS TOO MUCH UPON BATH
19-227-0017 MISSUS MORLAND HAD BEEN ALWAYS KINDLY DISPOSED TOWARDS EACH AND INSTANTLY PLEASED BY HIS APPEARANCE RECEIVED HIM WITH THE SIMPLE PROFESSIONS OF UNAFFECTED BENEVOLENCE THANKING HIM FOR SUCH AN ATTENTION TO HER DAUGHTER
19-227-0024 ASKED HER IF SHE WOULD HAVE THE GOODNESS TO SHOW HIM THE WAY YOU MAY SEE THE HOUSE FROM THIS WINDOW SIR WAS INFORMATION ON SARAH'S SIDE WHICH PRODUCED ONLY A BOW OF ACKNOWLEDGMENT FROM THE GENTLEMAN AND A SILENCING NOD FROM HER MOTHER
19-227-0031 SCARCELY OPENED HER LIPS DISMISSED THEM TO THE ECSTASIES OF ANOTHER TETE A TETE AND BEFORE IT WAS SUFFERED TO CLOSE SHE WAS ENABLED TO JUDGE HOW FAR HE WAS SANCTIONED BY PARENTAL AUTHORITY IN HIS PRESENT APPLICATION
19-227-0045 HER INTIMACY THERE HAD MADE HIM SERIOUSLY DETERMINE ON HER BEING HANDSOMELY LEGACIED HEREAFTER AND TO SPEAK OF HER THEREFORE AS THE ALMOST ACKNOWLEDGED FUTURE HEIRESS OF FULLERTON NATURALLY FOLLOWED
19-227-0052 HENRY WAS CONVINCED OF HIS FATHER'S BELIEVING IT TO BE AN ADVANTAGEOUS CONNECTION IT WAS NOT TILL THE LATE EXPLANATION AT NORTHANGER THAT THEY HAD THE SMALLEST IDEA OF THE FALSE CALCULATIONS WHICH HAD HURRIED HIM ON
19-227-0059 AS HE HAD LATELY HAD PARTICULAR OPPORTUNITIES OF DISCOVERING AIMING AT A STYLE OF LIFE WHICH THEIR FORTUNE COULD NOT WARRANT SEEKING TO BETTER THEMSELVES BY WEALTHY CONNECTIONS A FORWARD BRAGGING SCHEMING RACE
1926-143879-0000 CHAPTER THIRTY ONE ISABEL CAME BACK TO FLORENCE BUT ONLY AFTER SEVERAL MONTHS AN INTERVAL SUFFICIENTLY REPLETE WITH INCIDENT IT IS NOT HOWEVER DURING THIS INTERVAL THAT WE ARE CLOSELY CONCERNED WITH HER
1926-143879-0007 A VERY DIFFERENT PERSON FROM THE FRIVOLOUS YOUNG WOMAN FROM ALBANY WHO HAD BEGUN TO TAKE THE MEASURE OF EUROPE ON THE LAWN AT GARDENCOURT A COUPLE OF YEARS BEFORE
1926-143879-0014 AND WITH COSTLY CEREMONIES BY LILY BUT THOUGHT OF AS NOISILY VACANT BY ISABEL WHO IN THESE DAYS MADE
1926-143879-0028 SET HER RIGHT AGAIN SHE WAS SO FOND OF THE SPECTACLE OF HUMAN LIFE THAT SHE ENJOYED EVEN THE ASPECT OF GATHERING DUSK IN THE LONDON STREETS THE MOVING CROWDS THE HURRYING CABS THE LIGHTED SHOPS THE FLARING STALLS THE DARK
1926-143879-0035 HER CHARACTER HAD REVEALED ITSELF
1926-143879-0042 A STATIONARY AFFECTION IN OTHER WORDS WAS IMPOSSIBLE IT MUST MOVE ONE WAY OR THE OTHER HOWEVER THAT MIGHT BE THE GIRL HAD IN THESE DAYS A THOUSAND USES FOR HER SENSE OF THE ROMANTIC WHICH WAS MORE ACTIVE THAN IT HAD EVER BEEN
1926-147979-0008 GUESTS FELT THAT THEY WERE RECEIVING NOT CONFERRING A FAVOR WHEN THEY STAYED AT HER HOUSE EVEN THE SMARTEST TRAVELING MEN WERE FLATTERED WHEN MISSUS GARDENER STOPPED TO CHAT WITH THEM FOR A MOMENT
1926-147979-0022 AND HIS MAMMY SAID HE WAS N'T ALL WRONG SHE NAMED HIM SAMSON BECAUSE HE WAS BLIND BUT ON THE PLANTATION HE WAS KNOWN AS YELLOW MARTHA'S SIMPLE CHILD
1926-147979-0036 SEVERAL TEACHERS EXPERIMENTED WITH HIM THEY FOUND HE HAD ABSOLUTE PITCH AND A REMARKABLE MEMORY AS A VERY YOUNG CHILD HE COULD REPEAT AFTER A FASHION ANY COMPOSITION THAT WAS PLAYED FOR HIM NO MATTER HOW MANY WRONG NOTES HE STRUCK HE NEVER LOST THE INTENTION OF A PASSAGE

1926-147987-0024 WHEN HE RETURNED HE TOLD HER THAT HE WOULD HAVE TO STAY OVERNIGHT THERE
196-122150-0006 DISABLED BY A FALLING SPAR AT THE BEGINNING OF A WEEK OF WHICH HIS SCOTTISH CAPTAIN USED TO SAY AFTERWARDS MAN IT'S A PAIRFECT MEERACLE TO ME HOW SHE LIVED THROUGH IT SPENT MANY DAYS STRETCHED ON HIS BACK DAZED BATTERED HOPELESS
196-122150-0013 BROUGHT INTO THE BARE ROOM THE SOFTNESS OF THE SKY THE LANGUOR OF THE EARTH THE BEWITCHING BREATH OF THE EASTERN WATERS THERE WERE PERFUMES IN IT SUGGESTIONS OF INFINITE REPOSE THE GIFT OF ENDLESS DREAMS
196-122150-0020 THE DETERMINATION TO LOUNGE SAFELY THROUGH EXISTENCE TO JIM THAT GOSSIPING CROWD VIEWED AS SEAMEN SEEMED AT FIRST MORE UNSUBSTANTIAL THAN SO MANY SHADOWS BUT AT LENGTH HE FOUND A FASCINATION IN THE SIGHT OF THOSE MEN
196-122150-0034 ITS EYE OF FLAME AS IF IN DERISION OF HER ERRAND OF FAITH SHE CLEARED THE STRAIT CROSSED THE BAY CONTINUED ON HER WAY THROUGH THE ONE DEGREE PASSAGE SHE HELD ON STRAIGHT FOR THE RED SEA UNDER A SERENE SKY
196-122152-0000 HE SAID SPEAKING OF THE SHIP SHE WENT OVER WHATEVER IT WAS AS EASY AS A SNAKE CRAWLING OVER A STICK THE ILLUSTRATION WAS GOOD THE QUESTIONS WERE AIMING AT FACTS
196-122152-0007 AS IF FACTS COULD EXPLAIN ANYTHING AFTER YOU HAD CONCLUDED YOU HAD COLLIDED WITH SOMETHING FLOATING AWASH SAY A WATER LOGGED WRECK YOU WERE ORDERED BY YOUR CAPTAIN TO GO FORWARD AND ASCERTAIN IF THERE WAS ANY DAMAGE DONE
196-122152-0021 FELT A SHIVER RUN DOWN HIS BACK THE BIG ASSESSOR HAD DROPPED HIS EYELIDS AND DRUMMED ON WITHOUT A SOUND CARELESS AND MOURNFUL THE EYES OF THE OTHER ABOVE THE SUNBURNT CLASPED FINGERS
196-122152-0028 HE HAD COME ACROSS THAT MAN BEFORE IN THE STREET PERHAPS HE WAS POSITIVE HE HAD NEVER SPOKEN TO HIM FOR DAYS FOR MANY DAYS HE HAD SPOKEN TO NO ONE BUT HAD HELD SILENT INCOHERENT AND ENDLESS CONVERSE WITH HIMSELF
196-122159-0001 AND YET A MYSTERIOUS LIGHT SEEMED TO SHOW ME HIS BOYISH HEAD AS IF IN THAT MOMENT THE YOUTH WITHIN HIM HAD FOR A MOMENT GLOWED AND EXPIRED YOU ARE AN AWFUL GOOD SORT TO LISTEN

1963-142393-0010 IT WOULD BE WORSE TO HAVE A DISCOURAGING ANSWER BY LETTER THAN FROM HER OWN LIPS FOR HER PRESENCE RECONCILED HIM TO HER WILL YOU PERCEIVE HOW IT WAS ADAM WAS HUNGERING FOR THE SIGHT OF DINAH
1963-142393-0017 AND SELFISH EVEN A BLASPHEMOUS SPIRIT WHICH REJOICES AND IS THANKFUL OVER THE PAST EVIL THAT HAS BLIGHTED OR CRUSHED ANOTHER BECAUSE IT HAS BEEN MADE A SOURCE OF UNFORESEEN GOOD TO OURSELVES
1963-142393-0024 SOMETHING LIKE THIS SENSE OF ENLARGED BEING WAS IN ADAM'S MIND THIS SUNDAY MORNING AS HE RODE ALONG IN VIVID RECOLLECTION OF THE PAST
1963-142393-0037 HE HAD SET HIS MIND ON FOLLOWING HER AND BRINGING HER HOME SHE WAS GONE TO SLOMAN'S END A HAMLET ABOUT THREE MILES OFF OVER THE HILL THE OLD WOMAN TOLD HIM
1963-142393-0051 ADAM WAS GLAD FOR WITH THE FINE INSTINCT OF A LOVER HE FELT THAT IT WOULD BE BEST FOR HER TO HEAR HIS VOICE BEFORE SHE SAW HIM HE CAME WITHIN THREE PACES OF HER AND THEN SAID DINAH

198-126831-0023 AS WE SAT THERE THE AWKWARD MAN PASSED BY WITH HIS GUN OVER HIS SHOULDER AND HIS DOG AT HIS SIDE HE DID NOT LOOK LIKE AN AWKWARD MAN THERE IN THE HEART OF THE MAPLE WOODS

2092-145709-0014 INSISTED ALWAYS ON KEEPING WATCH ALONE SO SHE LIVED IN SOLITUDE ALL THE DAYTIME AND AT NIGHT SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN FRIGHTENED HAD SHE NOT BEEN SO BRAVE BUT EVERY DAY
2092-145709-0021 IT WAS DIFFICULT TO BELIEVE THAT IT WAS THE SAME FOR IT HAD ALL BEEN REBUILT AND DONE UP AGAIN

211-122442-0001 WHOM HE HAD SENT HOME TWO HOURS BEFORE FROM THE HOTEL DE VILLE TELLING HIM TO SIT UP FOR HIM OPENED THE DOOR FOR HIM THE READER MAY ASK
211-122442-0008 WHILE READING THIS LETTER D'ARTAGNAN FELT HIS HEART DILATED AND COMPRESSED BY THAT DELICIOUS SPASM WHICH TORTURES AND CARESSES THE HEARTS OF LOVERS IT WAS THE FIRST BILLET HE HAD RECEIVED IT WAS THE FIRST RENDEZVOUS THAT HAD BEEN GRANTED HIM

2136-5140-0007 AND THERE WAS CONFUSION IN THE HOUSE AND I DARE SAY THE MAIDS MADE AS MUCH OF A HOLIDAY AS THEY COULD I REMEMBER FEELING A SORT OF AWE OF THIS LITTLE DARK MAN BUT I WAS NOT AFRAID OF HIM FOR HE WAS GENTLE THOUGH SAD AND SEEMED KIND
2136-5140-0021 YES A STONE WALL WITH PILLARS TOO HIGH FOR EITHER YOU OR ME TO SEE OVER BUT HERE HE MENTIONED A NAME WHICH I THINK MUST HAVE BEEN SWEDENBORG
2136-5140-0028 HOW TRUE THE DESCRIPTION IS WHICH I GIVE YOU I WAS VERY FRIGHTENED FOR I FEARED THAT WHEN HE HAD DONE HIS NARRATIVE
2136-5140-0035 WITH STERN LIPS AND UPTURNED HANDS AND EYES AND AN ANGRY EXPOSTULATION I DO WONDER AT YOU MARY QUINCE LETTING THE CHILD WALK INTO THE WOOD WITH THAT LIMB OF DARKNESS IT IS A MERCY HE DID NOT SHOW HER THE DEVIL

2159-179154-0006 AT EACH INDIVIDUAL AWOKE HIM ONE OF THE SUBJECTS WHEN QUESTIONED AFTERWARD AS TO WHAT SENSATION HE EXPERIENCED AT THE SNAPPING OF THE FINGERS REPLIED THAT IT SEEMED TO HIM AS IF SOMETHING INSIDE OF HIS HEAD RESPONDED
2159-179154-0013 THEY IMMEDIATELY BEGAN AND TWIRLED THEM FASTER AND FASTER IN SPITE OF THEIR EFFORTS TO STOP ONE OF THE SUBJECTS SAID HE THOUGHT OF NOTHING BUT THE STRANGE ACTION OF HIS HANDS AND SOMETIMES IT PUZZLED HIM TO KNOW WHY THEY WHIRLED
2159-179154-0020 HIS EYES ASSUMED THE SAME EXPRESSION THAT HAD BEEN NOTICED IN HIS COMPANION'S HE TOO AROSE IN THE SAME ATTITUDE AS IF HIS HEAD WERE PULLING THE BODY ALONG AND FOLLOWING THE FINGER IN THE SAME WAY AS HIS PREDECESSOR
2159-179154-0034 ALL THE WORLD LOVES A LOVER AS THE SAYING IS AND ALL THE WORLD LOVES TO LAUGH AT HIM ONE OF THE SUBJECTS WAS TOLD THAT THE HEAD OF A MAN IN THE AUDIENCE WAS ON FIRE
2159-179156-0001 THE SENSATIONS PRODUCED DURING A STATE OF HYPNOSIS ARE VERY INTERESTING AS MAY BE SUPPOSED THEY DIFFER GREATLY IN DIFFERENT PERSONS
2159-179156-0008 YET I WAS CONSCIOUS THAT WHILE ONE PART OF MY MIND WANTED TO OPEN MY EYES ANOTHER PART DID NOT WANT TO SO I WAS IN A PARADOXICAL STATE I BELIEVED THAT I COULD OPEN MY EYES AND YET COULD NOT
2159-179156-0021 WAS PLAYED FROM THE PIANO SCORE THE PULSE OF THE SUBJECT BECAME MORE RAPID AND AT FIRST OF HIGHER TENSION INCREASING FROM A NORMAL RATE OF SIXTY BEATS A MINUTE TO ONE HUNDRED TWENTY THEN
2159-179156-0035 AND CLAIRVOYANCE IF THE POWERS OF THE MIND ARE SO ENORMOUSLY INCREASED ALL THAT IS REQUIRED OF A VERY SENSITIVE AND EASILY HYPNOTIZED PERSON IS TO HYPNOTIZE HIM OR HERSELF WHEN HE WILL BE ABLE TO READ THOUGHTS
2159-179157-0013 THE ROAR BECAME DEAFENING IT CRACKLED LIKE A MIGHTY FIRE I WAS FEARFULLY CONSCIOUS OF MYSELF HAVING READ VIVID ACCOUNTS OF DREAMS VISIONS ET CETERA IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT I WOULD EXPERIENCE THEM
2159-179157-0020 FOR INSTANCE THE EFFECTS OF AN EXCITING RELIGIOUS REVIVAL ARE VERY LIKE THOSE PRODUCED BY MESMER'S OPERATIONS IN PARIS THE SUBJECTS BECOME HYSTERICAL AND ARE READY TO BELIEVE ANYTHING OR DO ANYTHING
2159-179157-0027 THAT HE HAS EXPERIMENTED IN THIS DIRECTION WITH PATIENTS OF HIS SAYS HE THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO RESIST THE STATE OR TO BRING IT AT WILL MANY OF THEM DESCRIBE BEAUTIFUL SCENES FROM NATURE OR SOME MIGHTY CATHEDRAL
2182-150130-0007 ALL OF US AS WE GROW OLDER HAVE IN OUR MEMORY PICTURES OF BY GONE TIMES THAT ARE SOMEHOW MORE THAN USUALLY VIVID THE COLORS OF SOME NOT BLURRING BY TIME AS OTHERS DO
2182-150130-0014 BUT AT THE BEST ONLY RUDE STORIES AND JESTS RECITED BY SOME STROLLING MUMMER OR MINSTREL TO THE LISTENING CIRCLE GATHERED AROUND THE BLAZE AND WELCOMING THE COARSE GROSS JESTS AND COARSER GROSSER SONGS WITH ROARS OF BOISTEROUS LAUGHTER
2182-150130-0021 AND EVEN THE LADS WHO HAD ENJOYED ITS PASSING WERE GLAD WHEN THE WINDS BLEW WARM ONCE MORE AND THE GRASS SHOWED GREEN IN SUNNY PLACES AND THE LEADER OF THE WILD FOWL BLEW HIS HORN AS THEY WHO IN THE FALL HAD FLOWN TO THE SOUTH FLEW ARROW LIKE NORTHWARD AGAIN
2182-150130-0035 HAND UNDER HAND UNTIL AT LAST HE HUNG DIRECTLY OVER THE TOP OF THE WALL AND PERHAPS A FOOT ABOVE IT BELOW HIM HE COULD SEE THE LEAFY TOP OF AN ARBOR COVERED WITH A THICK GROWTH OF CLEMATIS AND EVEN AS HE HUNG THERE
2182-181173-0002 AND THE AFTERNOON THEY SO AMAZED THE APPLE WOMAN OF ANCIENT LINEAGE BY STOPPING BEFORE HER STALL AND TELLING HER SHE WAS TO HAVE A TENT AND A STOVE AND A SHAWL AND A SUM OF MONEY WHICH SEEMED TO HER QUITE WONDERFUL
2182-181173-0009 HE'S VERY KIND IF HE IS AN EARL AND HE SENT ME A LOT OF MONEY BY MISTER HAVISHAM AND I'VE BROUGHT SOME TO YOU TO BUY JAKE OUT
2182-181173-0023 I'D COME TO SEE YOU REPLIED MISTER HOBBS GRACIOUSLY SO IT SEEMED TO BE AGREED THAT IF HE RECEIVED A PRESSING INVITATION FROM THE EARL TO COME AND SPEND A FEW MONTHS AT DORINCOURT CASTLE
2182-181173-0030 IT WAS JUST AT THE VERY LAST WHEN HE WAS STANDING LEANING ON THE RAILING OF THE UPPER DECK AND WATCHING THE FINAL PREPARATIONS ENJOYING THE EXCITEMENT AND THE SHOUTS OF THE SAILORS AND WHARFMEN
2182-181173-0037 AND HE HEARD NOTHING BUT THE HEARTY CHILDISH VOICE CALLING
2182-181183-0013 SO NO MORE AT PRESENT DICK
2182-181183-0020 MY I KNOW HER BETTER N I KNOW YOU THE YOUNG MAN BEGAN TO LAUGH WHERE DID YOU MEET HER DICK HE SAID AT NEWPORT OR WHEN YOU RAN OVER TO PARIS THE LAST TIME DICK ACTUALLY FORGOT TO GRIN
2182-181183-0027 PUT THEM TWO TOGETHER HER N THAT THERE SCAR WHY THAT THERE BOY O HERS AINT NO MORE A LORD THAN I AM IT'S BEN'S BOY THE LITTLE CHAP SHE HIT WHEN SHE LET FLY THAT PLATE AT ME
2196-170151-0004 URGING THEM TO WATCH CAREFULLY FOR THESE LOGS WHICH HE DESCRIBED AND TO NOTE THE PRECISE LOCATION OF EACH IN LATITUDE AND LONGITUDE AND THE TIME THE OBSERVATION WAS MADE HUNDREDS OF CAPTAINS SAILING OVER THE WATERS OF THE EARTH
2196-170151-0011 IN DISCOVERING AMERICA COLUMBUS FAILED ABSOLUTELY HIS INGENIOUS REASONING AND EXPERIMENT LED HIM TO BELIEVE THAT BY SAILING WESTWARD HE WOULD REACH INDIA EVERY REDMAN IN AMERICA CARRIES IN HIS NAME INDIAN
2196-170151-0018 THIS PURGING OF ALL THE DROSS OF TRIVIALITY AS HE PASSED THROUGH THE FURNACE OF POVERTY TRIAL AND SORROW GAVE ELOQUENCE TO HIS BRUSH AND ENABLED HIM TO PAINT AS NEVER BEFORE AS NO PROSPERITY WOULD HAVE MADE POSSIBLE
2196-170151-0032 NO MATTER WHAT STATISTICS OF FAILURE A NEAR SIGHTED AND HALF BLIND WORLD OF CRITICS AND COMMENTATORS MAY LAY AT HIS DOOR HIGH IDEALS NOBLE EFFORTS WILL MAKE SEEMING FAILURES BUT TRIFLES
2196-170379-0004 WAS CONVINCED THAT HYPNOSIS WAS A FORM OF HYSTERIA AND THAT ONLY HYSTERICS COULD BE HYPNOTIZED THE FORMER MESMER THOUGHT FURTHER THAT METAL BECAME IMBUED BY THE SOLAR QUALITIES AND HIS SYSTEM IS ALSO KNOWN AS METALOGY
2196-170379-0011 THE WORD IS USED BECAUSE HYPNOSIS SUPERFICIALLY RESEMBLES SLEEP INASMUCH AS THE EYES USUALLY ARE CLOSED THE BODY IN A POSTURE OF COMPLETE RELAXATION ACTUALLY THE MIND IS HYPERACUTE
2196-170379-0024 MAKES US ONCE MORE AS LITTLE CHILDREN A CONDITION TO BE DESIRED FOR CERTAIN FORMS OF THERAPY AN ATAVISTIC THEORY HELD TO SOME EXTENT BY DOCTOR JEROME M SCHNECK CLINICAL ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR OF PSYCHIATRY
2196-170379-0031 ARE EQUALLY APPLICABLE TO SELF HYPNOSIS EXCEPT WHERE AS IN TRANSFERENCE IT IS OBVIOUS A THERAPIST IS NEEDED IN CONCLUSION THE AUTHOR WOULD LIKE TO TAKE ISSUE WITH THOSE
2196-174172-0003 THEN YOUR YOUTH MAY BE PERPETUAL THE HUMAN RACE IS EVER YOUNG ITS UNITS FALL OFF YOU SHOULD BE YOUNGER AT SIXTY THAN AT SIXTEEN
2196-174172-0017 GROW IN EACH DAY AND MAKE EACH DAY GROW CHECK DISCORD QUIT USELESS DISCUSSION FOR IT WEAKENS AND WITHERS STOP QUARRELING CHECK COMPLAININGS ROOT CRITICISM OUT OF YOUR LIFE
2196-174172-0024 AND WORK WITH CONFIDENT EXPECTATION PUT RULES AND SYSTEM INTO YOUR DAILY TASK EXERCISE YOUR SELF CONTROL YOUR SELF POSSESSION SELF MASTERY MARCH UP TO YOUR TASK WITH EFFICIENCY
2196-174172-0031 IT IS ONE OF THE MOST DELIGHTFUL SOUNDS OF EARTH MOST UTTERLY LOST IS THE DAY YOU LAUGH NOT MIRTH CLEARS THE MIRRORS OF THE MIND A PERSON WHO DOES NOT LAUGH IS NOT HEALTHY
226-122538-0002 STRENGTH AND WHITENESS THOUGHT JANE AS SHE PACED THE STEAMER'S DECK AND AFTER A TWO YEARS ABSENCE HER HEART WENT OUT TO HER NATIVE LAND THEN DOVER CASTLE CAUGHT HER EYE SO BEAUTIFUL IN THE PEARLY LIGHT OF THAT SPRING AFTERNOON
226-122538-0009 BUT THE INJURED PARTS WERE PROGRESSING FAVOURABLY AND ALL FEAR OF BRAIN COMPLICATIONS SEEMED OVER DURING THE LAST FEW DAYS HOWEVER A SERIOUS REACTION FROM SHOCK HAS SET IN AND IT HAS BEEN CONSIDERED NECESSARY TO SUMMON SIR DERYCK BRAND
226-122538-0016 AND JUST AS THE TRAIN BEGAN TO MOVE HANDED A CUP OF STEAMING COFFEE AND A PLATE OF BREAD AND BUTTER IN AT THE WINDOW OH THANK YOU MY GOOD FELLOW SAID JANE PUTTING THE PLATE ON THE SEAT WHILE SHE DIVED INTO HER POCKET
226-122538-0030 PILOTED JANE THROUGH THE CROWD OPENED THE DOOR OF A NEAT ELECTRIC BROUGHAM HELPED HER IN TOOK HIS SEAT BESIDE HER AND THEY GLIDED SWIFTLY OUT INTO THE STRAND AND TURNED TOWARDS TRAFALGAR SQUARE
226-131532-0002 THE FOUNDATION IS IN THE WICKEDNESS AND FALSEHOOD OF THE WORLD SAID I AND IN THE FACT THAT MISTER LAWRENCE HAS BEEN SEEN TO GO THAT WAY ONCE OR TWICE OF AN EVENING AND THE VILLAGE GOSSIPS SAY HE GOES TO PAY HIS ADDRESSES TO THE STRANGE LADY
226-131532-0009 WITH THE PROSPECT OF BEING GRAVELY USHERED IN BY RACHEL TO THE PRESENCE OF A SURPRISED UNCORDIAL MISTRESS THAT SO GREATLY DISTURBED ME MY WISH HOWEVER WAS NOT GRATIFIED
226-131532-0023 AND NEVER GILBERT PUT ME TO THE PAINFUL NECESSITY OF REPEATING WHAT I HAVE JUST NOW SAID TO YOU SHE EARNESTLY ADDED GIVING ME HER HAND IN SERIOUS KINDNESS HOW SWEET HOW MUSICAL MY OWN NAME SOUNDED IN HER MOUTH

226-131533-0002 AND STILL I MADE OUR MEETINGS APPEAR THE RESULT OF ACCIDENT AS OFTEN AS I COULD FOR I FOUND IT NECESSARY TO BE EXTREMELY CAREFUL AND ALTOGETHER I BEHAVED WITH SUCH EXCEEDING PROPRIETY THAT SHE NEVER HAD OCCASION TO REPROVE ME ONCE
226-131533-0016 JANE WILSON THINKS YOUR VISITS TO THE OLD HALL BUT ANOTHER PROOF OF HER DEPRAVITY CONFOUND JANE WILSON AND ELIZA MILLWARD IS QUITE GRIEVED ABOUT YOU I HOPE SHE IS
226-131533-0023 WITH HIS HANDS CLASPED UPON ITS HEAD I HAVE BEEN BUSY I SAID FOR AN APOLOGY WAS EVIDENTLY DEMANDED BUSY REPEATED HE DERISIVELY YES YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN GETTING IN MY HAY
226-131533-0030 AND ALL I HAVE REASON TO SUSPECT AND WHAT OTHERS TELL ME CONCERNING YOU SO I TOLD HER YOU DID SIR CRIED I STARTING FROM MY SEAT AND STRIKING MY FIST ON THE TABLE
2289-152253-0007 NOTICED BLOOD DRIPPING FROM THE FOOT OF ONE OF THE OXEN THE SHEPHERD FOLLOWED THE STREAK OF BLOOD THROUGH THE GRASS AND AT LAST FOUND THE SHARP POINT OF A SWORD STICKING OUT OF THE EARTH HE DUG OUT THE WEAPON CARRIED IT TO THE PALACE
2289-152253-0014 ATTILA AND HIS TERRIBLE HUNS MARCHED THROUGH GAUL UNTIL THEY CAME TO THE CITY OF ORLEANS HERE THE PEOPLE BRAVELY RESISTED THE INVADERS THEY SHUT THEIR GATES AND DEFENDED THEMSELVES IN EVERY WAY THEY COULD
2289-152253-0021 THOR'IS MOND THE SON OF THEODORIC
2289-152254-0004 AND MARCHED INTO OTHER PARTS OF THE COAST AND CAPTURED TOWNS AND CITIES BY THIS TIME BONIFACE HAD LEARNED ALL ABOUT THE WICKED PLOT OF AETIUS HE NOW REGRETTED HAVING INVITED THE VANDALS TO AFRICA AND TRIED TO INDUCE THEM TO RETURN TO SPAIN
2289-152254-0011 SHE AND HER FRIENDS WILL HELP YOU AS MUCH AS THEY CAN WITH A CRY OF JOY GENSERIC SPRANG TO HIS FEET AND EXCLAIMED TELL THE EMPRESS THAT I ACCEPT HER INVITATION I SHALL SET OUT FOR ROME IMMEDIATELY
2289-152254-0018 AND OTHER COUNTRIES BELONGING TO ROME AND MAJORIAN RESOLVED TO PUNISH THEM SO HE GOT TOGETHER A GREAT ARMY AND BUILT A FLEET OF THREE HUNDRED SHIPS TO CARRY HIS TROOPS TO CARTHAGE
2289-152257-0001 BUT HE WAS DETERMINED TO GO EVEN THOUGH HE SHOULD HAVE TO WALK EVERY STEP OF THE ROAD AND LIVE ON FRUITS THAT HE COULD GATHER BY THE WAY HE WAS A BRIGHT CLEVER BOY WHO HAD SPENT HIS LIFE HITHERTO IN A VILLAGE BUT WAS NOW EAGER TO GO OUT INTO THE WORLD
2289-152257-0015 AND PREFERRED TO BE UNDER THE GOVERNMENT OF THE ROMANS ABOUT TEN MILES FROM CARTHAGE HE MET A LARGE ARMY LED BY THE BROTHER OF GELIMER A BATTLE IMMEDIATELY TOOK PLACE AND THE VANDALS WERE UTTERLY DEFEATED
2289-152258-0001 AND THE PROPER NAME FOR THEIR RELIGION IS ISLAM WHICH MEANS OBEDIENCE OR SUBMISSION
2289-152258-0008 THIS WOMAN WAS A WIDOW WHO WAS CARRYING ON THE BUSINESS LEFT HER BY HER HUSBAND AS SOON AS THE CAMEL DRIVER SAW MOHAMMED HE STOPPED HIM AND SAID MY MISTRESS WISHES TO SEE YOU BEFORE NOON I THINK SHE INTENDS TO ENGAGE YOU TO TAKE CHARGE OF HER CARAVANS
2289-152258-0015 WORSHIPED IDOLS VERY FEW OF THEM WERE CHRISTIANS
2289-152258-0029 THE REMAINDER OF HIS LIFE A SPLENDID CHURCH WAS BUILT FOR HIM IN MEDINA IT WAS CALLED A MOSQUE AND ALL MOHAMMEDAN CHURCHES OR PLACES OF WORSHIP
2289-152258-0036 THERE IS A MOSQUE CALLED THE GREAT MOSQUE IT IS A LARGE ENCLOSURE IN THE FORM OF A QUADRANGLE OR SQUARE
229-130880-0002 REENTERING THE LOUNGE I FIRST NOTED THE BEARINGS OF CEYLON ON WHICH ANTIQUITY LAVISHED SO MANY DIFFERENT NAMES
229-130880-0016 YET IT STRIKES ME THAT DIVING SUITS LIKE YOURS COULD PERFORM YEOMAN SERVICE IN SUCH WORK YES SINCE THOSE POOR FISHERMEN CAN'T STAY LONG UNDERWATER ON HIS VOYAGE TO CEYLON
229-130880-0023 THE FISHERMEN ARE WELL PAID AREN'T THEY HARDLY PROFESSOR IN PANAMA THEY MAKE JUST ONE DOLLAR PER WEEK IN MOST PLACES THEY EARN ONLY A PENNY FOR EACH OYSTER THAT HAS A PEARL AND THEY BRING UP SO MANY THAT HAVE NONE
229-130880-0030 YOU MIGHT WANT TO THINK IT OVER BEFORE ACCEPTING AS FOR ME I PASSED A HAND OVER MY BROW WHERE BEADS OF COLD SWEAT WERE BUSY FORMING LET'S THINK THIS OVER I SAID TO MYSELF AND LET'S TAKE OUR TIME
229-130880-0044 FOR MY PART I STARED AT THEM WITH ANXIOUS EYES AS IF THEY WERE ALREADY MISSING A LIMB OR TWO SHOULD I ALERT THEM YES SURELY BUT I HARDLY KNEW HOW TO GO ABOUT IT WOULD MASTER

229-130880-0058 THEY EVEN MENTION ONE OYSTER ABOUT WHICH I REMAIN DUBIOUS
229-130880-0072 BUT I DON'T THINK THESE FISHERIES BRING IN THE RETURNS THEY ONCE DID SIMILARLY THE CENTRAL AMERICAN FISHERIES
229-130880-0079 BUT YOU CAN ABSOLUTELY TRUST ME ON THIS PROFESSOR ITS PEARLS WERE SO BIG
229-130880-0086 SHAKING HIS HEAD IN FACT I SAID MISTER LAND IS RIGHT AND IF WE EVER BROUGHT BACK TO EUROPE OR AMERICA A PEARL WORTH MILLIONS IT WOULD MAKE THE STORY OF OUR ADVENTURES MORE AUTHENTIC AND MUCH MORE REWARDING THAT'S HOW I SEE IT
233-134440-0006 HIS NECK THIN HIS LEGS FEEBLE HE WAS DIRTY EVERYTHING ABOUT HIM WAS UNCLEAN EVEN THE WHITES OF HIS EYES LOOKED SOILED I GO TOO FAST NOT EVERYTHING ABOUT WASH WAS UNCLEAN
233-134440-0013 IN WINESBURG NO ATTENTION WAS PAID TO WASH WILLIAMS AND HIS HATRED OF HIS FELLOWS ONCE MISSUS WHITE THE BANKER'S WIFE COMPLAINED TO THE TELEGRAPH COMPANY
233-134440-0020 HE ONCE TOLD THE STORY TO GEORGE WILLARD AND THE TELLING OF THE TALE CAME ABOUT IN THIS WAY GEORGE WILLARD WENT ONE EVENING TO WALK WITH BELLE CARPENTER A TRIMMER OF WOMEN'S HATS
233-134440-0034 THEY WITH THEIR SOFT HANDS AND THEIR BLUE EYES THE SIGHT OF A WOMAN SICKENS ME WHY I DON'T KILL EVERY WOMAN I SEE I DON'T KNOW
233-134440-0041 WASH WILLIAMS BEGAN TELLING THE STORY OF HIS MARRIED LIFE WITH THE TALL BLONDE GIRL WITH THE BLUE EYES WHOM HE HAD MET WHEN HE WAS A YOUNG OPERATOR AT DAYTON OHIO HERE AND THERE HIS STORY WAS TOUCHED WITH MOMENTS OF BEAUTY
233-134440-0048 FOR A MOMENT THERE WAS A CATCH IN THE VOICE OF THE MAN TALKING IN THE DARKNESS I LOVED HER HE SAID I DON'T CLAIM NOT TO BE A FOOL I LOVE HER YET THERE IN THE DUSK IN THE SPRING EVENING
233-134440-0061 THE YOUNG REPORTER FELT ILL AND WEAK IN IMAGINATION HE ALSO BECAME OLD AND SHAPELESS I DIDN'T GET THE MOTHER KILLED SAID WASH WILLIAMS STARING UP AND DOWN THE STREET I STRUCK HER ONCE WITH A CHAIR
233-155990-0005 WHO WERE INCAPABLE OF OPPRESSING THE WEAK OR OF PERMITTING THEIR COUNTRY WITH THEIR CONSENT TO OPPRESS THE WEAK BUT WHO DID NOT HESITATE TO DRAW THE SWORD WHEN TO LEAVE IT UNDRAWN MEANT INABILITY TO ARREST TRIUMPHANT WRONG
233-155990-0012 RESTS ULTIMATELY UPON THE JUDGE AND THE POLICEMAN AND THE COMPLETE ABSENCE OF THE POLICEMAN AND THE ALMOST COMPLETE ABSENCE OF THE JUDGE IN INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS PREVENTS THERE BEING AS YET ANY REAL HOMOLOGY
233-155990-0026 THEY GO WRONG AT THE OUTSET FOR THEY LAY ALL THE EMPHASIS ON PEACE AND NONE AT ALL ON RIGHTEOUSNESS THEY ARE NOT ALL OF THEM PHYSICALLY TIMID MEN BUT THEY ARE USUALLY MEN
233-155990-0033 REALIZES THE IDEALS OF THE PERSONS WHO WISH THE UNITED STATES TO DISARM AND THEN TRUST THAT OUR HELPLESSNESS WILL SECURE US A CONTEMPTUOUS IMMUNITY FROM ATTACK BY OUTSIDE NATIONS
233-155990-0040 LOOKING BACK FROM THE VANTAGE POINT OF A SCORE OF YEARS PROBABLY EVERY ONE WILL AGREE THAT HE WAS AN ABSURD PERSON BUT HE WAS NOT ONE WHIT MORE ABSURD THAN MOST OF THE MORE PROMINENT PERSONS WHO ADVOCATE DISARMAMENT BY THE UNITED STATES
2384-152900-0007 THERE WERE BUNKS FOR TEN MEN IN TWO STAGES SIX ON ONE WALL AND FOUR ON THE OTHER THE FURNITURE OF THE ROOM CONSISTED OF A TABLE A STOOL FOR EACH MAN AND A LUX LAMP
2384-152900-0014 WE HAD TEN SLEDGES MADE BY A FIRM OF SPORTING OUTFITTERS IN CHRISTIANIA THEY WERE BUILT LIKE THE OLD NANSEN SLEDGES BUT RATHER BROADER AND WERE TWELVE FEET LONG THE RUNNERS WERE OF THE BEST AMERICAN HICKORY SHOD WITH STEEL
2384-152900-0021 ONE MAN WAS SUFFICIENT TO SET UP THE TENT IN THE STIFFEST BREEZE I HAVE COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THE FEWER POLES A TENT HAS THE EASIER IT IS TO SET UP WHICH SEEMS QUITE NATURAL THESE TENTS HAVE ONLY ONE POLE
2384-152900-0035 WE THEN WENT TO WORK TO MAKE CLOTHES AFTER THE PATTERN OF THE NETCHELLI ESKIMO AND THE SEWING WENT ON EARLY AND LATE THICK ANORAKS AND THIN ONES HEAVY BREECHES AND LIGHT WINTER STOCKINGS AND SUMMER STOCKINGS
2384-152900-0042 OUR BURBERRY WIND CLOTHES WERE MADE IN THE FORM OF ANORAK BLOUSE AND TROUSERS BOTH VERY ROOMY THE OTHERS CONSISTED OF TROUSERS AND JACKET WITH HOOD OUR MITS WERE FOR THE MOST PART SUCH AS ONE CAN BUY IN ANY SHOP
2384-152900-0049 FOR IF THEY HAD KNOWN IT THEY COULD NOT POSSIBLY HAVE LET IT GO SO FAR THE FACT IS THAT IN THIS CASE SENSATION IS A SOMEWHAT DOUBTFUL GUIDE FOR THE FEET LOSE ALL SENSATION
2384-152900-0063 IF I HAD EVER CHERISHED ANY ILLUSIONS ON THE SUBJECT OF A DAINTY LITTLE FOOT I AM SURE THE LAST TRACE OF SUCH VANITY DIED OUT ON THE DAY I PASSED THE SHOEMAKER'S WINDOW AND BEHELD MY OWN BOOTS
2384-152900-0070 AND THIS IS UNDOUBTEDLY THE BEST WAY OF UTILIZING THE POWER I HAD MADE UP MY MIND TO ADOPT THE SAME SYSTEM IN SLEDGING ON THE BARRIER ANOTHER GREAT ADVANTAGE IT HAD WAS THAT THE DOGS WOULD PASS SINGLY ACROSS FISSURES
2384-152900-0077 AND SNOW GOGGLES FROM DOCTOR SCHANZ
2391-145015-0001 AND AS IT CURVES ROUND PRESENTS A GOOD VIEW OF IT ON THE LEFT HAND TO THOSE WHO ARE TRAVELLING DOWN THE LINE ABOUT THREE MILES BEFORE ENTERING THE TUNNEL UNDER POPHAM BEACON IT MAY BE KNOWN TO SOME SPORTSMEN AS LYING IN ONE OF THE BEST PORTIONS OF THE VINE HUNT
2391-145015-0008 EACH WELL PROVIDED WITH A GARDEN SCATTERED ABOUT PRETTILY ON EITHER SIDE OF THE ROAD IT WAS SUFFICIENTLY COMMODIOUS TO HOLD PUPILS IN ADDITION TO A GROWING FAMILY AND WAS IN THOSE TIMES CONSIDERED TO BE ABOVE THE AVERAGE OF PARSONAGES
2391-145015-0015 AND WAS FORMED INTO A RUSTIC SHRUBBERY WITH OCCASIONAL SEATS ENTITLED THE WOOD WALK THE OTHER RAN STRAIGHT UP THE HILL UNDER THE NAME OF THE CHURCH WALK BECAUSE IT LED TO THE PARISH CHURCH
2391-145015-0029 AFTER THE DEATH OF THEIR OWN PARENTS THE TWO YOUNG COOPERS PAID LONG VISITS AT STEVENTON EDWARD COOPER DID NOT LIVE UNDISTINGUISHED
2391-145015-0036 SHE AND HER SECOND HUSBAND WENT TO FRANCE IN THE HOPE OF RECOVERING SOME OF THE COUNT'S PROPERTY AND THERE NARROWLY ESCAPED BEING INCLUDED AMONGST THE DETENUS ORDERS HAD BEEN GIVEN BY BUONAPARTE'S GOVERNMENT TO DETAIN ALL ENGLISH TRAVELLERS
2391-145015-0043 HE ACCOMPANIED THIS FRIEND TO THE WEST INDIES AS CHAPLAIN TO HIS REGIMENT AND THERE DIED OF YELLOW FEVER TO THE GREAT CONCERN OF HIS FRIEND AND PATRON WHO AFTERWARDS DECLARED THAT IF HE HAD KNOWN OF THE ENGAGEMENT HE WOULD NOT HAVE PERMITTED HIM TO GO OUT TO SUCH A CLIMATE
2391-145015-0057 AS POPE SAYS NOR DOES LIFE'S STREAM FOR OBSERVATION STAY IT HURRIES ALL TOO FAST TO MARK THEIR WAY IMPORTANT INVENTIONS SUCH AS THE APPLICATIONS OF STEAM GAS AND ELECTRICITY MAY FIND THEIR PLACES IN HISTORY
2391-145015-0064 ONE HOUSE WOULD PRIDE ITSELF ON ITS HAM ANOTHER ON ITS GAME PIE AND A THIRD ON ITS SUPERIOR FURMITY OR TANSEY PUDDING BEER AND HOME MADE WINES ESPECIALLY MEAD WERE MORE LARGELY CONSUMED VEGETABLES WERE LESS PLENTIFUL AND LESS VARIOUS
2391-145015-0071 WE SHOULD MISS THE SLIDING BOOKCASES AND PICTURE STANDS
2391-145015-0084 THE GRACEFUL CARRIAGE OF EACH WEAPON WAS CONSIDERED A TEST OF HIGH BREEDING THE CLOWNISH MAN WAS IN DANGER OF BEING TRIPPED UP BY HIS SWORD GETTING BETWEEN HIS LEGS
2391-145015-0098 WELL DRESSED YOUNG MEN OF MY ACQUAINTANCE WHO HAD THEIR COAT FROM A LONDON TAILOR WOULD ALWAYS BRUSH THEIR EVENING SUIT THEMSELVES RATHER THAN ENTRUST IT TO THE CARELESSNESS OF A ROUGH SERVANT AND TO THE RISKS OF DIRT AND GREASE IN THE KITCHEN
2391-145015-0112 THE FEW THAT REMAIN ARE BANISHED FROM GOOD SOCIETY AND EMPLOYED ONLY IN MENIAL WORK BUT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS AGO THEY WERE CELEBRATED IN POETRY AND CONSIDERED SO CLEVER A CONTRIVANCE THAT GAY IN HIS TRIVIA
2391-145015-0119 AND DID NOT ADMIT OF GADDING AND GOSSIPING ABOUT THE VILLAGE THE IMPLEMENT USED WAS A LONG NARROW MACHINE OF WOOD RAISED ON LEGS FURNISHED AT ONE END WITH A LARGE WHEEL AND AT THE OTHER WITH A SPINDLE ON WHICH THE FLAX OR WOOL WAS LOOSELY WRAPPED
2416-152137-0003 AND THAT WAS ALL HE HAD EVER SEEN OF HER ALL THAT HE HAD EVER HEARD OF HER EXCEPT THOSE LETTERS OF COURSE EACH OF WHICH HAD OUTLINED THE DETAILS OF SOME AFFAIR FOR THE GRAY SEAL TO EXECUTE
2416-152137-0017 SLIPPING THE LETTER INTO HIS POCKETBOOK HE SNATCHED UP HIS HAT FROM THE SEAT RACK THERE WAS STILL A CHANCE KNOWING HE WAS THERE SHE WOULD BE ON HER GUARD BUT IN THE LOBBY AMONG THE CROWD AND UNAWARE OF HIS PRESENCE
2416-152137-0024 AND DISAPPOINTMENT THAT BURNED WITHIN HIM STEPPED OUT TO THE PAVEMENT AND HEADED DOWN BROADWAY AFTER ALL HE HAD KNOWN IT IN HIS HEART OF HEARTS ALL THE TIME IT HAD
2416-152137-0031 A PRONOUNCEMENT UPON HIMSELF THAT MIGHT MEAN LIFE OR DEATH HE HURRIED ON PEOPLE STILL PASSED BY HIM TOO MANY AND THEN A CAFE JUST AHEAD
2416-152139-0008 AND WITH A LOW STARTLED CRY STARED ACROSS THE ROOM JIMMIE DALE WAS LEANING BACK AGAINST THE DOOR THAT WAS CLOSED NOW BEHIND HIM AND ON JIMMIE DALE'S FACE WAS A BLACK SILK MASK
2416-152139-0015 EXTRACTED THE KEY FROM THE DOOR LOCK HELD IT UP FOR THE OTHER TO SEE THEN DROPPED IT INTO HIS POCKET AND HIS VOICE COLD BEFORE
2416-152139-0022 IN MOYNE'S HOME UP IN HARLEM
2416-152139-0036 WHEN YOU MUST HAVE MONEY OR FACE RUIN AND EXPOSURE YOU SAW IT THEN A YEAR AGO THE DAY THAT MOYNE CONCEALING NOTHING OF HIS PRISON RECORD APPLIED THROUGH FRIENDS FOR A POSITION IN THE BANK
2416-152139-0043 THE EX CONVICT IN THE BANK'S EMPLOY YOU KNEW MOYNE WAS DINING OUT TO NIGHT YOU KNEW WHERE AND AT A HINT FROM YOU THE POLICE TOOK UP THE TRAIL A LITTLE LATER IN THE EVENING YOU TOOK THESE TWO PACKAGES OF BANKNOTES FROM THE REST
2416-152139-0050 AND BESIDES OF COURSE NOT UNTIL YOU HAD PLANTED THE EVIDENCE THAT WAS TO DAMN HIM AND WRECK HIS LIFE AND HOME YOU WERE EVEN GENEROUS IN THE AMOUNT YOU DEPRIVED YOURSELF OF OUT OF THE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS
2416-152139-0064 OR HYDROCYANIC ACID PROBABLY THE MOST DEADLY POISON AND THE SWIFTEST IN ITS ACTION THAT WAS KNOWN TO SCIENCE CARLING HAD PROVIDED AGAINST THAT SOME DAY IN HIS CONFESSION FOR A LITTLE SPACE
2416-152139-0071 WITH THE PARCEL UNDER HIS ARM STEPPED TO THE DOOR AND UNLOCKED IT HE PAUSED FOR AN INSTANT ON THE THRESHOLD FOR A SINGLE QUICK COMPREHENSIVE GLANCE AROUND THE ROOM THEN PASSED ON OUT INTO THE STREET
2436-2476-0005 I WENT TO MY CABIN IT WAS LOCATED AFT ON THE STERN DECK NEAR THE STERN WATCH TOWER A SMALL METAL ROOM WITH A CHAIR A DESK AND A BUNK I MADE SURE NO ONE WAS IN IT I SEALED THE LATTICE GRILL AND THE DOOR
2436-2476-0019 I DEAL IN TRICKS HOW TO FOOL AN AUDIENCE HIS KEEN AMUSED GAZE WAS ON OB HAHN THIS GENTLEMAN FROM VENUS AND I HAVE TOO MUCH IN COMMON TO ARGUE
2436-2476-0026 I GAZED AFTER HIS SMALL WHITE SUITED FIGURE AS HE FOLLOWED ANITA FROM THE SALON AND THINKING OF HER I PRAYED THAT CARTER AND HALSEY MIGHT BE WRONG WHATEVER PLOTTING AGAINST THE GRANTLINE EXPEDITION MIGHT BE GOING ON
2436-2476-0033 SHE LOOKED AS ALL MARTIANS LIKE TO LOOK A VERY WARLIKE AMAZON BUT SHE WAS A PRETTY GIRL SHE SMILED AT ME WITH A KEEN EYED DIRECT GAZE MISTER DEAN SAID AT BREAKFAST THAT YOU WERE BIG AND HANDSOME YOU ARE
2436-2477-0006 WITH THE BLACK HEAVENS AND THE BLAZING STARS WAS BEFORE HER THERE WAS AN EMPTY SEAT NEARBY SHE GREETED ME WITH THE VENUS FORM OF JOCULAR INTIMATE GREETING HOLA LO GREGG SIT HERE WITH ME
2436-2477-0013 THAT'S WHAT HE TOLD ME NO I NEVER HEARD OF HIM NOR DID I AND I THOUGHT I HAD HEARD OF EVERYONE OF IMPORTANCE HE IS LISTED FOR THE SAME THEATER I AM NICE SORT OF FELLOW SHE PAUSED THEN ADDED
2436-2477-0020 THEY ANYONE SOMETHING'S GOING ON YOU KNOW IT YOU ARE IN IT I SAW YOU THIS MORNING GREGG WILD EYED CHASING A PHANTOM YOU AND I HEARD THE PHANTOM A MAN'S FOOTSTEPS A MAGNETIC
2436-2477-0033 A HUNDRED POUNDS OF GOLD LEAF THAT'S THE PURSER'S PRICE HE'S WITH THEM WHATEVER IT IS HE PROMISED TO DO SOMETHING OR OTHER FOR THEM SHE STOPPED WELL I PROMPTED THAT'S ALL
2436-2481-0003 PASSENGERS STANDING AT THEIR CABIN DOORS I SHOUTED GO BACK TO YOUR ROOMS WE WANT ORDER HERE KEEP BACK WE CAME TO THE TWIN DOORS OF A TWENTY TWO AND A TWENTY BOTH WERE CLOSED DOCTOR FRANK WAS IN ADVANCE OF SNAP AND ME NOW
2436-2481-0010 TELL BLACKSTONE WHAT'S HAPPENED BUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENED CARTER WAS GRIM AND WHITE
2436-2481-0024 THE SIZZLING WAS FAINTLY AUDIBLE MY DOOR SEAL WAS BREAKING UPON IMPULSE I REACHED FOR THE DOOR JERKED IT OPEN NO ONE THERE
2436-2481-0031 MY TONGUE WAS THICK BUT IT MOVED YES I WAS SOON REVIVED I SAT UP WITH DOCTOR FRANK VIGOROUSLY RUBBING ME I'M ALL RIGHT I TOLD THEM WHAT HAD HAPPENED
248-130644-0000 IT WOULD BE A LITTLE HARD TO BLAME THE RECTOR OF PENNICOTE THAT IN THE COURSE OF LOOKING AT THINGS FROM EVERY POINT OF VIEW HE LOOKED AT GWENDOLEN AS A GIRL LIKELY TO MAKE A BRILLIANT MARRIAGE
248-130644-0014 BUT WOULD MAKE THE VERY BEST OF THE CHANCES THAT LIFE OFFERED HER AND CONQUER CIRCUMSTANCES BY HER EXCEPTIONAL CLEVERNESS
248-130644-0021 FOR SUBJECTS ARE APT TO APPEAR STUPID TO THE YOUNG AS LIGHT SEEMS DULL TO THE OLD BUT SHE WOULD NOT HAVE FELT AT ALL HELPLESS IN RELATION TO THEM IF THEY HAD TURNED UP IN CONVERSATION IT MUST BE REMEMBERED THAT NO ONE HAD DISPUTED HER POWER OR HER GENERAL SUPERIORITY
248-130644-0028 A DECISION OF WILL WHICH MADE ITSELF FELT IN HER GRACEFUL MOVEMENTS AND CLEAR UNHESITATING TONES SO THAT IF SHE CAME INTO THE ROOM ON A RAINY DAY WHEN EVERYBODY ELSE WAS FLACCID AND THE USE OF THINGS IN GENERAL WAS NOT APPARENT TO THEM
248-130652-0005 THE BEAUTIFUL LIVER COLORED WATER SPANIEL WHICH SAT WITH ITS FOREPAWS FIRMLY PLANTED AND ITS EXPRESSIVE BROWN FACE TURNED UPWARD WATCHING GRANDCOURT WITH UNSHAKEN CONSTANCY
248-130652-0012 SHALL YOU RIDE OR DRIVE TO QUETCHAM TO DAY I AM NOT GOING TO QUETCHAM YOU DID NOT GO YESTERDAY GRANDCOURT SMOKED IN SILENCE FOR HALF A MINUTE AND THEN SAID
248-130652-0019 WHEN HE SAID PERHAPS IN A LOWER TONE THAN EVER BUT WITH A PERCEPTIBLE EDGE OF CONTEMPT WHAT IN THE NAME OF NONSENSE HAVE I TO DO WITH MISS ARROWPOINT AND HER MUSIC
248-130652-0033 AND LUSH MORE AND MORE IN NEED OF THE LAZY LUXURY TO WHICH HIS TRANSACTIONS ON BEHALF OF GRANDCOURT MADE NO INTERRUPTION WORTH RECKONING I CANNOT SAY THAT THE SAME LENGTHENED HABIT HAD INTENSIFIED GRANDCOURT'S WANT OF RESPECT FOR HIS COMPANION
248-130697-0000 ALL THINGS ARE CHANGES NOT INTO NOTHING BUT INTO THAT WHICH IS NOT AT PRESENT MARCUS AURELIUS
248-130697-0007 BUT IF I HAD NOT HAD THAT MURDEROUS WILL THAT MOMENT IF I HAD THROWN THE ROPE ON THE INSTANT PERHAPS IT WOULD HAVE HINDERED DEATH NO I THINK NOT SAID DERONDA SLOWLY
248-130697-0021 IT COULD NEVER BE MY IMPULSE TO FORSAKE YOU SAID DERONDA PROMPTLY WITH THAT VOICE WHICH LIKE HIS EYES HAD THE UNINTENTIONAL EFFECT OF MAKING HIS READY SYMPATHY SEEM MORE PERSONAL AND SPECIAL THAN IT REALLY WAS
248-130697-0028 WHEN YOU ARE AMONG YOUR FRIENDS AGAIN YOU WILL DISCERN NEW DUTIES SAID DERONDA MAKE IT A TASK NOW TO GET AS WELL AND CALM AS MUCH LIKE YOURSELF AS YOU CAN BEFORE HE HESITATED
248-130697-0035 HE ROSE AS HE SPOKE AND SHE GAVE HIM HER HAND SUBMISSIVELY BUT WHEN HE HAD LEFT HER SHE SANK ON HER KNEES IN HYSTERICAL CRYING THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THEM WAS TOO GREAT
250-140277-0012 AND THE PROBLEMS SURROUNDING SYMBOLS AND CULTS THESE CHAPTERS LEAD UP TO A DISCUSSION OF THE PERSONAL ASPECT OF THE SPIRITUAL LIFE ITS CURVE OF GROWTH CHARACTERS AND ACTIVITIES
250-142276-0002 WHICH WAS MIDWAY BETWEEN OLDNESS AND NEWNESS HAD PROVED UNAVAILING AND THAT AS HE HAD NOT THE MONEY TO EQUIP HIS WIFE AFRESH FROM TOP TO TOE SHE WOULD NOT SHOW HERSELF AT HER ONLY SISTER'S ONLY CHILD'S WEDDING
250-142276-0009 AND SHE WAS NOT SORRY TO THINK THAT THEIR MEETING AND GREETING WOULD TAKE PLACE AT HELSTONE PARSONAGE RATHER THAN DURING THE CONFUSION OF THE LAST TWO OR THREE DAYS IN THE HOUSE IN HARLEY STREET WHERE SHE HERSELF HAD HAD TO PLAY THE PART OF FIGARO
250-142276-0023 FULL OF DIMPLES AND GLANCES THAT SPOKE OF CHILDISH GLADNESS AND BOUNDLESS HOPE IN THE FUTURE IT WAS THE LATTER PART OF JULY WHEN MARGARET RETURNED HOME THE FOREST TREES WERE ALL ONE DARK FULL DUSKY GREEN
250-142276-0030 WITH THE HEALTHY SHAME OF A CHILD SHE BLAMED HERSELF FOR HER KEENNESS OF SIGHT IN PERCEIVING THAT ALL WAS NOT AS IT SHOULD BE THERE HER MOTHER HER MOTHER ALWAYS SO KIND AND TENDER TOWARDS HER
250-142276-0037 NOT SO PLEASANT IN THE LATTER HALF OF SEPTEMBER THE AUTUMNAL RAINS AND STORMS CAME ON AND MARGARET WAS OBLIGED TO REMAIN MORE IN THE HOUSE THAN SHE HAD HITHERTO DONE
250-142276-0050 SOMETIMES AMUSED AND QUESTIONING AT OTHERS A LITTLE INCLINED TO COMPARE HER SISTER'S CIRCUMSTANCES OF EASE AND COMFORT WITH THE NARROWER MEANS AT HELSTONE VICARAGE ON SUCH EVENINGS MARGARET WAS APT TO STOP TALKING RATHER ABRUPTLY
250-142286-0000 CHAPTER TWELVE MORNING CALLS WELL I SUPPOSE WE MUST FRIENDS IN COUNCIL
250-142286-0014 IT WILL DO YOU GOOD INSTEAD OF HARM
250-142286-0021 MISSUS HALE WAS MAKING RATHER MORE EXERTION IN HER ANSWERS CAPTIVATED BY SOME REAL OLD LACE WHICH MISSUS THORNTON WORE LACE AS SHE AFTERWARDS OBSERVED TO DIXON OF THAT OLD ENGLISH POINT WHICH HAS NOT BEEN MADE FOR THIS SEVENTY YEARS AND
250-142286-0028 AS FANNY HAD PUT IT IT DID SEEM AS IF THEY HAD BEEN IMPERTINENTLY DISCUSSING MISSUS THORNTON'S FEELINGS BUT SHE ALSO ROSE UP AGAINST THAT LADY'S MANNER OF SHOWING THAT SHE WAS OFFENDED MISSUS THORNTON WENT ON AFTER A MOMENT'S PAUSE
2514-149482-0009 IN WHICH THERE WAS ALWAYS A COMFORT GOOD NATURE IN HIS CONDITIONS HAD A TENDENCY TO MAKE HIM ASHAMED WHICH AUNT MAUD INDEED WONDERFULLY LIKING HIM FOR HIMSELF QUITE STRUCK HIM AS HAVING GUESSED TO SPARE HIM THEREFORE SHE ALSO AVOIDED DISCUSSION
2514-149482-0016 AND HE HAD THE AMUSEMENT OF SEEING IN HER AS THROUGH A CLEAR GLASS THE OUTBREAK OF A PLAN AND THE SUDDEN CONSCIOUSNESS OF A CURIOSITY SHE BECAME AWARE OF AMERICA UNDER HIS EYES AS A POSSIBLE SCENE FOR SOCIAL OPERATIONS
2514-149482-0023 HIGH AND FIXED THIS ESTIMATE RULED ON EACH OCCASION AT LANCASTER GATE THE SOCIAL SCENE SO THAT HE NOW RECOGNISED IN IT SOMETHING LIKE THE ARTISTIC IDEA THE PLASTIC SUBSTANCE IMPOSED BY TRADITION BY GENIUS BY CRITICISM
2514-149482-0037 THIS CIRCUMSTANCE OF THEIR CHARMING FRIEND'S ILLNESS WAS THE FIRST THING KATE TOOK UP WITH DENSHER ON THEIR BEING ABLE AFTER DINNER
2514-149482-0044 BOTH TO RESIST HIS EMBARRASSMENT AND TO CATCH THE FULL REVELATION HIS EMBARRASSMENT CAME NATURALLY FROM THE FACT THAT IF HE COULD CLAIM NO CREDIT FOR MISS THEALE'S SUCCESS SO NEITHER COULD HE GRACEFULLY INSIST ON HIS NOT HAVING BEEN CONCERNED WITH HER
2514-149482-0051 TO A PERCEPTION OF MORE ELEMENTS IN THE OCCASION THAN HE WAS HIMSELF ABLE TO COUNT SHE WAS ACCESSIBLE TO SIDES OF IT HE IMAGINED THAT WERE AS YET OBSCURE TO HIM FOR THOUGH SHE UNMISTAKEABLY REJOICED AND SOARED
2514-149482-0065 THOUGH WHAT IT EXPRESSED HE FAILED AT THE TIME TO MAKE OUT YOU WEREN'T PRESENT THEN DEAREST MISSUS LOWDER RICHLY CONCURRED YOU DON'T KNOW SHE CONTINUED WITH MELLOW GAIETY HOW FAR THINGS MAY HAVE GONE
2514-149482-0072 BUT YOU DIDN'T FORGET HER AUNT MAUD INTERPOSED WITH ALMOST MENACING ARCHNESS
2514-149482-0079 HE WONDERED AFTERWARDS IF KATE HAD MADE THIS OUT THOUGH IT WAS NOT INDEED TILL MUCH LATER ON THAT HE FOUND HIMSELF IN THOUGHT DIVIDING THE THINGS SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN CONSCIOUS OF FROM THE THINGS SHE MUST HAVE MISSED
2514-149482-0093 THERE CAME ANOTHER IT MUST BE ADDED AND DOUBTLESS AS A RESULT OF SOMETHING THAT OVER THE CLOTH DID HANG BETWEEN THEM WHEN SHE STRUCK HIM AS HAVING QUITE ANSWERED DEAR NO FOR WHAT DO YOU TAKE ME
2514-149482-0100 THAT IT WAS TRUE WOULD BE WHAT SHE MUST REVEAL ONLY WHEN DRIVEN TO HER LAST ENTRENCHMENTS AND WELL CORNERED IN HER PASSION THE RARE PASSION OF FRIENDSHIP THE SOLE PASSION OF HER LITTLE LIFE SAVE THE ONE OTHER MORE IMPERTURBABLY CEREBRAL
2514-149482-0107 TAKE THEM ALL UP ON TRUST FURTHER ON HE MET IT PEACEFULLY A LITTLE PERHAPS AS AN EXAMPLE TO MISSUS STRINGHAM OH AS FAR ON AS YOU LIKE THIS EVEN HAD ITS EFFECT MISSUS STRINGHAM APPROPRIATED AS MUCH OF IT AS MIGHT BE MEANT FOR HERSELF
2518-154825-0013 JUST AT THE END OF THIS FLAT LEDGE FARTHEST FROM WHERE THE BRIDLE PATH LEADS DOWN BUT NOT A HUNDRED YARDS FROM WHERE WE STAND THERE IS A SHEEP TRACK LEADING UP THE CLIFF IT STARTS
2518-154825-0020 AND TWAS A TASK THAT MIGHT COW THE BRAVEST AND WHEN I LOOKED UPON THE ZIGZAG IT SEEMED BETTER TO STAY WHERE WE WERE AND FALL INTO THE HANDS OF THE POSSE THAN SET FOOT ON THAT AWFUL WAY AND FALL UPON THE ROCKS BELOW
2518-154825-0027 IN A MINUTE I KNEW FROM ELZEVIR'S STEPS THAT HE HAD LEFT THE TURF AND WAS UPON THE CHALK NOW I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THERE WERE HALF A DOZEN MEN BESIDE IN ENGLAND WHO WOULD HAVE VENTURED UP THAT PATH EVEN FREE AND UNTRAMMELLED
2518-154825-0041 FELT A SICKENING QUALM AND SWIMMING OF THE BRAIN AND KNEW THAT I WAS GIDDY AND MUST FALL THEN I CALLED OUT TO ELZEVIR AND HE GUESSING WHAT HAD COME OVER ME CRIES TO TURN UPON MY SIDE AND PRESS MY BELLY TO THE CLIFF
2518-154825-0048 I THINK I COULD HAVE DONE IT BUT THERE WAS ONLY THE CLIFF WALL SHEER AND WHITE AGAINST THAT NARROWEST WAY WITH NEVER CRANNY TO PUT A FINGER INTO THE WIND WAS BLOWING IN FRESH PUFFS AND THOUGH I DID NOT OPEN MY EYES
2518-154825-0055 AND I COULD OPEN MY EYES WITHOUT A TRACE OF GIDDINESS SO I BEGAN TO MOVE FORWARD AGAIN ON HANDS AND KNEES AND ELZEVIR
2518-154826-0011 THE GROUND WAS BRASHY WITH FLAT STONES AND DIVIDED UP INTO TILLAGE FIELDS IT WAS A BLEAK WIDE BITTEN PLACE ENOUGH LOOKING AS IF TWOULD NEVER PAY FOR TURNING AND INSTEAD OF HEDGES THERE WERE DREARY WALLS BUILT OF DRY STONE WITHOUT MORTAR
2518-154826-0018 AND NOW THAT I WAS UNDER THE LEE OF THE WALL
2518-154826-0025 WE SHALL HAVE TO SHOW OURSELVES AND WHILE HE SPOKE THERE WAS A RATTLE OF FALLING STONES WHERE THE BOY WAS PARTLY CLIMBING AND PARTLY PULLING DOWN THE DRY WALL AND SO ELZEVIR STOOD UP THE BOY LOOKED FRIGHTENED AND MADE AS IF HE WOULD RUN OFF
2518-154826-0039 ELZEVIR WAS STILL WALKING STRONGLY IN SPITE OF THE HEAVY BURDEN HE CARRIED AND IN LESS THAN HALF AN HOUR I KNEW THOUGH I HAD NEVER BEEN THERE BEFORE WE WERE IN THE LAND OF THE OLD MARBLE QUARRIES AT THE BACK OF ANVIL POINT
2518-154826-0046 ON WHICH THE MARBLE BLOCKS WERE ONCE HAULED UP BY WOODEN WINCHES DOWN THESE STEPS NO FEET EVER WALKED NOW FOR NOT ONLY WERE SUFFOCATING GASES SAID TO BESET THE BOTTOM OF THE SHAFTS
2518-154826-0053 AND WALKED ON AS IF HE KNEW THE WAY I COULD SEE NOTHING BUT PERCEIVED THAT WE WERE PASSING THROUGH ENDLESS GALLERIES CUT IN THE SOLID ROCK HIGH ENOUGH FOR THE MOST PART TO ALLOW OF WALKING UPRIGHT BUT SOMETIMES SO LOW AS TO FORCE HIM TO BEND DOWN
254-12312-0012 INARIME DID NOT MORE QUICKLY MOVE WHEN TYPHEUS DID THE VAST HUGE HILLS REMOVE AND FOR DESPITE INTO THE SEA THEM THREW THUS SHALL IT THEN BE LOST BY WAYS NOT FEW
254-12312-0019 IN DARK AND OBSCURE TERMS THE SUBORNERS OF MEN ARE THE MAKERS OF MATCHES WHICH ARE COMMONLY FRIENDS AFTER THE TWO CHASES ARE MADE HE THAT WAS IN THE UPPER END OF THE TENNIS COURT GOETH OUT

254-127705-0025 THAT SAME DAY THE OLD CHIEF WAS CAPTURED ON THE CLIFF ON THE EAST SIDE OF INDIAN CANYON BY SOME OF BOLING'S SCOUTS AS TENAYA WALKED TOWARD THE CAMP HIS EYE FELL UPON THE DEAD BODY OF HIS FAVORITE SON CAPTAIN BOLING
254-127705-0032 TO THIS THEY REPLIED THAT TENAYA HAD NEVER CONSENTED TO THE SALE OF THEIR VALLEY AND HAD NEVER RECEIVED PAY FOR IT THE OTHER CHIEF THEY SAID HAD NO RIGHT TO SELL THEIR TERRITORY
254-145458-0003 IN WHICH THE FREE LANCE MIGHT GRADUATE AND HE COULD SPEAK OF HIS ALMA MATER WHETHER THE GLOBE OR THE PALL MALL WITH AS MUCH PRIDE AS HE NEVER DOUBTED THE GLOBE OR THE PALL MALL WOULD SPEAK ONE DAY OF HIM
254-145458-0010 OUR EFFORTS TO BE FUNNY IN THE SAKI MANNER HAVE NOT SURVIVED TO PROVE IT WHAT IS SAKI'S MANNER
254-145458-0017 LET US TAKE A SAMPLE OR TWO OF SAKI NINETEEN ELEVEN THE EARLIER STAGES OF THE DINNER HAD WORN OFF THE WINE LISTS HAD BEEN CONSULTED

27-123349-0018 TO THE EXCLUSION BILL AND TO THE CHARACTER OF THE EARL OF SHAFTESBURY BUT IN VAIN LOCKE NEITHER BROKE OUT NOR DISSEMBLED BUT MAINTAINED SUCH STEADY SILENCE AND COMPOSURE AS FORCED THE TOOLS OF POWER TO OWN WITH VEXATION
27-123349-0025 AND AT THE HEAD OF A GREAT BODY OF HIS FOLLOWERS
27-123349-0032 THERE WAS THEREFORE AT THE HAGUE AN EXTREME ANXIETY TO AVOID ALL THAT COULD GIVE HIM OFFENCE THE PERSONAL INTEREST OF WILLIAM WAS ALSO ON THIS OCCASION IDENTICAL WITH THE INTEREST OF HIS FATHER IN LAW
27-123349-0045 DEPARTED FROM THE COURSE WHICH THEY ORDINARILY OBSERVED IN THE TRANSACTION OF BUSINESS ON THE SAME DAY ON WHICH HE MADE HIS APPLICATION TO THEM AN ORDER DRAWN IN EXACT CONFORMITY WITH HIS REQUEST

2764-36616-0005 AND THE TORPEDO HAS LED TO THIS UNDERWATER BATTERING RAM WHICH IN TURN WILL LEAD TO THE WORLD PUTTING ITS FOOT DOWN AT LEAST I HOPE IT WILL BUT THIS HYPOTHESIS OF A WAR MACHINE COLLAPSED IN THE FACE OF FORMAL DENIALS FROM THE VARIOUS GOVERNMENTS
2764-36616-0019 WE MUST LOOK FOR THE ANIMAL IN QUESTION AMONG THOSE MARINE CREATURES ALREADY CATALOGED AND IN THIS EVENT I WOULD BE INCLINED TO ACCEPT THE EXISTENCE OF A GIANT NARWHALE
2764-36616-0026 THESE LAST WORDS WERE COWARDLY OF ME BUT AS FAR AS I COULD I WANTED TO PROTECT MY PROFESSORIAL DIGNITY AND NOT LAY MYSELF OPEN TO LAUGHTER FROM THE AMERICANS WHO WHEN THEY DO LAUGH LAUGH RAUCOUSLY
2764-36616-0033 THE SHIPPING AND MERCANTILE GAZETTE THE LLOYD'S LIST FRANCE'S PACKETBOAT AND MARITIME AND COLONIAL REVIEW ALL THE RAGS DEVOTED TO INSURANCE COMPANIES WHO THREATENED TO RAISE THEIR PREMIUM RATES WERE UNANIMOUS ON THIS POINT
2764-36617-0008 WELL VERSED IN THE THEORY OF CLASSIFICATION HE WAS POORLY VERSED IN ITS PRACTICAL APPLICATION AND I DOUBT THAT HE COULD TELL A SPERM WHALE FROM A BALEEN WHALE AND YET WHAT A FINE GALLANT LAD

2764-36617-0036 THE WONDERFUL RIGHT BANK OF THIS RIVER ALL LOADED DOWN WITH COUNTRY HOMES AND PASSED BY THE FORTS TO SALUTES FROM THEIR BIGGEST CANNONS
2764-36619-0004 AND MANEUVERED INSTEAD TO DOUBLE CAPE HORN THE CREW SIDED WITH HIM UNANIMOUSLY INDEED WERE WE LIKELY TO ENCOUNTER THE NARWHALE IN SUCH A CRAMPED STRAIT MANY OF OUR SAILORS SWORE THAT THE MONSTER COULDN'T NEGOTIATE THIS PASSAGEWAY SIMPLY BECAUSE HE'S TOO BIG FOR IT
2764-36619-0011 IF MASTER'S EYES WOULD KINDLY STOP BULGING MASTER WILL SEE FARTHER BUT WHAT A WASTE OF ENERGY THE ABRAHAM LINCOLN WOULD CHANGE COURSE AND RACE AFTER THE ANIMAL SIGHTED ONLY TO FIND AN ORDINARY BALEEN WHALE
2764-36619-0025 THIS REACTION MOUNTED UPWARD FROM THE BOWELS OF THE SHIP FROM THE QUARTERS OF THE BUNKER HANDS TO THE MESSROOM OF THE GENERAL STAFF AND FOR CERTAIN IF IT HADN'T BEEN FOR COMMANDER FARRAGUT'S CHARACTERISTIC STUBBORNNESS THE FRIGATE WOULD ULTIMATELY HAVE PUT BACK TO THAT CAPE IN THE SOUTH
2764-36619-0032 WHILE THE ABRAHAM LINCOLN HEAVED TO ITS LONGBOATS RADIATED IN EVERY DIRECTION AROUND IT AND DIDN'T LEAVE A SINGLE POINT OF THE SEA UNEXPLORED BUT THE EVENING OF NOVEMBER FOURTH ARRIVED WITH THIS UNDERWATER MYSTERY STILL UNSOLVED

2817-142380-0029 HE FORESAW ENOUGH HE'D NO RIGHT TO EXPECT ANYTHING BUT HARM AND SHAME TO HER

2836-5354-0042 SCARCELY HAD SHE CLOSED THE DOOR UPON HERSELF AND THE TRAY WHEN SIR FRANCIS LEVISON APPEARED EQUIPPED FOR TRAVELING GOOD BYE ISABEL SAID HE WITHOUT FURTHER CIRCUMLOCUTION OR CEREMONY
2836-5355-0001 SHE PURSUED BENDING HER EYES DETERMINATELY UPON HIM IT MUST BE WITH ALL MY HEART RETURNED SIR FRANCIS IT IS YOU WHO HAVE THROWN OUT THE CHALLENGE MIND
2836-5355-0008 IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER TO HAVE UNDECEIVED ME THEN TO HAVE TOLD ME THAT THE HOPES I WAS CHERISHING FOR THE SAKE OF THE UNBORN CHILD WERE WORSE THAN VAIN I DID NOT JUDGE SO HE REPLIED THE EXCITED STATE YOU THEN APPEARED TO BE IN
2836-5355-0015 IF YOU HAVE TAKEN THIS AVERSION TO ME IT CANNOT BE HELPED HE COLDLY SAID INWARDLY CONGRATULATING HIMSELF LET US NOT DOUBT AT BEING SPARED THE WORK OF TROUBLE HE HAD ANTICIPATED YOU MADE COMMOTION ENOUGH ONCE ABOUT ME MAKING YOU REPARATION

2836-5355-0043 RESUMED SIR FRANCIS IN A LITTLE TIME YOU MAY PROBABLY WISH TO RECALL IT IN WHICH CASE A LINE ADDRESSED TO ME AT MY BANKER'S WILL LADY ISABEL DREW HERSELF UP PUT AWAY THOSE NOTES IF YOU PLEASE SHE INTERRUPTED NOT ALLOWING HIM TO FINISH HIS SENTENCE
2843-152918-0002 THERE WAS THUS NO GREAT SIGN OF DEPRESSION TO BE NOTICED WHEN WE CAME BACK INTO THE TENT AFTER FINISHING OUR WORK AND HAD TO WHILE AWAY THE TIME AS I WENT IN I COULD DESCRY WISTING A LITTLE WAY OFF KNEELING ON THE GROUND
2843-152918-0009 NO IT WAS AWFUL SHALL WE TRY IT NO SOONER WAS THE PROPOSAL SUBMITTED THAN IT WAS ACCEPTED UNANIMOUSLY AND WITH ACCLAMATION WHEN I THINK OF MY FOUR FRIENDS OF THE SOUTHERN JOURNEY
2843-152918-0016 AS WE HAD NOTHING TO LEAN AGAINST WE WENT ON LIKE THIS SLOWLY ENOUGH BUT THE MAIN THING WAS THAT WE MADE PROGRESS THE GROUND AT FIRST GAVE ONE THE IMPRESSION OF RISING THOUGH NOT MUCH THE GOING WAS EXTREMELY HEAVY
2843-152918-0030 THE SUN SHOWED AS YET LIKE A PAT OF BUTTER AND HAD NOT SUCCEEDED IN DISPERSING THE THICK MISTS THE WIND HAD DROPPED SOMEWHAT BUT WAS STILL FAIRLY STRONG THIS IS AFTER ALL THE WORST PART OF ONE'S JOB
2843-152918-0037 WE COULD NOW ONCE MORE SET OUR FACES TO THE SOUTH AND IN THICK DRIVING SNOW WE CONTINUED OUR WAY INTO THE UNKNOWN WITH GOOD ASSISTANCE FROM THE HOWLING NORTH EASTERLY GALE WE NOW RECOMMENCED THE ERECTION OF BEACONS
2843-152918-0044 INSTEAD OF RISING GRADUALLY WE WERE GOING SLOWLY DOWN
2843-152918-0058 BUT THE DAY DID NOT TURN OUT SO BADLY AFTER ALL AS WE WORKED OUR WAY OUT OF THIS UNCERTAINTY AND FOUND OUT WHAT WAS BEHIND THE PITCH DARK CLOUDS DURING THE FORENOON THE SUN CAME THROUGH AND THRUST ASIDE THE FOG FOR A WHILE AND THERE
2843-152918-0065 IT WAS PLAIN ENOUGH THAT WE SHOULD HAVE STIFF WORK IT WAS THEREFORE IMPORTANT TO HAVE AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE ON THE SLEDGES WE SET TO WORK AT ONCE TO BUILD THE DEPOT THE SNOW HERE WAS EXCELLENT FOR THIS PURPOSE
2843-152918-0072 THEY WERE NOT VERY GRAND BUT BETTER ONES WERE NOT TO BE OBTAINED FOR THAT MATTER THE SITE OF THE DEPOT WAS SO WELL MARKED BY ITS POSITION UNDER THE FOOT OF THE GLACIER THAT WE AGREED IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO MISS IT
2843-152918-0086 IN ALL DIRECTIONS AND EVOKED A PICTURE OF VIOLENT CONFUSION THANK GOD WE WERE NOT HERE WHILE THIS WAS GOING ON I THOUGHT TO MYSELF AS I STOOD LOOKING OUT OVER THIS BATTLEFIELD IT MUST HAVE BEEN A SPECTACLE LIKE DOOMSDAY
2843-152918-0093 FROM THIS POINT THE GLACIER AS FAR AS OUR VIEW EXTENDED TO THE SOUTH LOOKED BETTER AND BETTER
2843-152918-0100 AND FOR OUR FINAL SUCCESS WE OWE A DEEP DEBT OF GRATITUDE TO OUR PRUDENCE AND THOUGHTFULNESS IN ADOPTING THIS EXPEDIENT NEXT MORNING NOVEMBER TWENTY NINTH BROUGHT CONSIDERABLY CLEARER WEATHER
2843-152918-0114 PLUNGING WILDLY DOWN THE STEEP SIDES AND MERGING INTO THE UNDERLYING GROUND IN FEARFUL CONFUSION BUT THE MOST REMARKABLE OF THEM ALL WAS MOUNT HELMER HANSSEN ITS TOP WAS AS ROUND AS THE BOTTOM OF A BOWL
289-121652-0005 THE RESEARCH AFTER THE AUTHOR OF EACH INDIVIDUAL VERSE WOULD INDEED BE HOPELESS IT WOULD BE FOLLY TO SUPPOSE THEM ALL THE COMPOSITION OF UNEDUCATED OLD NURSES FOR MANY OF THEM CONTAIN MUCH REFLECTION WIT AND MELODY
289-121652-0012 RIQUET WITH THE TUFT CINDERELLA AND LITTLE THUMB EIGHT STORIES IN ALL ON THE COVER OF THE BOOK WAS DEPICTED AN OLD LADY HOLDING IN HER HAND A DISTAFF
289-121652-0026 SEEMED SO SENSELESS AND SILLY TO THE PEOPLE WHO OVERHEARD THEM THAT THEY BEGAN TO CALL HER MOTHER GOOSE IN DERISION THE TERM BEING DERIVED FROM QUEEN GOOSEFOOT THE MOTHER OF CHARLEMAGNE THE OLD NURSE PAID NO ATTENTION TO HER CRITICS
289-121652-0033 THAT THEY HAVE BEEN RELEGATED TO OBLIVION WHILE THE REAL GEMS OF THE COLLECTION WILL DOUBTLESS LIVE AND GROW IN POPULAR FAVOR FOR MANY AGES
289-121665-0001 AND STARTED OUT WITH HER SHEEP THAT THEY MIGHT FEED UPON THE TENDER JUICY GRASSES WITH WHICH THE HILLS ABOUNDED THE LITTLE GIRL USUALLY ACCOMPANIED HER MOTHER AND SAT BY HER SIDE
289-121665-0015 THEN YOU ARE WISER THAT MOST PEOPLE AND IF YOU KNOW ALL ABOUT THEM YOU ALSO KNOW THEY WILL COME HOME OF THEIR OWN ACCORD AND I HAVE NO DOUBT THEY WILL ALL BE WAGGING THEIR TAILS BEHIND THEM AS USUAL
289-121665-0022 LITTLE BO PEEP FELL FAST ASLEEP AND DREAMT SHE HEARD THEM BLEATING BUT WHEN SHE AWOKE SHE FOUND IT A JOKE FOR STILL THEY WERE A FLEETING THE GIRL NOW BECAME QUITE ANXIOUS AND WONDERED WHY THE OLD WOMAN HAD NOT DRIVEN HER FLOCK OVER THE HILL
289-121665-0029 BUT AFTER AWHILE THE TINY MAID REALIZED THAT ALL HER TEARS WOULD NOT BRING BACK THE TAILS TO HER LAMBKINS SO SHE PLUCKED UP COURAGE AND DRIED HER EYES AND AROSE FROM THE GROUND JUST AS THE OLD WOMAN HOBBLED UP TO HER
289-121665-0043 NO ONE IN THIS WORLD KNOWS ALL ABOUT ANYTHING SHEEP DO NOT HAVE LONG TAILS THERE IS ONLY A LITTLE STUMP TO ANSWER FOR A TAIL NEITHER DO RABBITS HAVE TAILS NOR BEARS NOR MANY OTHER ANIMALS
2893-139310-0003 A PARTIALLY OPENED DOOR GAVE A GLIMPSE OF THE CROWDED HALL AND ADMITTED A VAST UNEVEN TUMULT A HAMMERING CLAPPING AND SHOUTING THAT DIED AWAY AND BEGAN AGAIN AND ROSE TO A THUNDEROUS PITCH
2893-139310-0010 BECAUSE YOU ARE THE ATLAS SIRE SAID THE MAN IN YELLOW THE WORLD IS ON YOUR SHOULDERS THEY RULE IT IN YOUR NAME THE SOUNDS FROM THE HALL HAD DIED INTO A SILENCE
2893-139310-0023 ON THE ONE HAND WAS THE WHITE COUNCIL POWERFUL DISCIPLINED FEW
2893-139310-0037 THE HALL WAS A VAST AND INTRICATE SPACE GALLERIES BALCONIES BROAD SPACES OF AMPHITHEATRAL STEPS AND GREAT ARCHWAYS FAR AWAY HIGH UP SEEMED THE MOUTH OF A HUGE PASSAGE FULL OF STRUGGLING HUMANITY
2893-139310-0051 THE FLOW OF PEOPLE SMOTE DOWNWARD UNTIL THE UPTURNED FACES WERE BELOW THE LEVEL OF HIS FEET HE WAS AWARE OF A PATH BEFORE HIM OF A SUITE ABOUT HIM OF GUARDS AND DIGNITIES AND LINCOLN ON HIS RIGHT HAND
2893-139322-0004 STRUCK GRAHAM MOST VIVIDLY ONE LANK AND VERY HIGH CARRIAGE WITH LONGITUDINAL METALLIC RODS HUNG WITH THE DRIPPING CARCASSES OF MANY HUNDRED SHEEP ARRESTED HIS ATTENTION UNDULY ABRUPTLY THE EDGE OF THE ARCHWAY CUT
2893-139322-0011 THE LATTER DAY LABOURER MALE AS WELL AS FEMALE WAS ESSENTIALLY A MACHINE MINDER AND FEEDER A SERVANT AND ATTENDANT OR AN ARTIST UNDER DIRECTION THE WOMEN IN COMPARISON WITH THOSE GRAHAM REMEMBERED
2893-139322-0025 GRAHAM MADE SOME INDIGNANT COMMENTS BUT SIRE WE SIMPLY COULD NOT STAND THAT STUFF WITHOUT THE PURPLE SAID ASANO IN YOUR DAYS PEOPLE COULD STAND SUCH CRUDITIES THEY WERE NEARER THE BARBARIC BY TWO HUNDRED YEARS
2893-139322-0032 THAT WALK LEFT ON GRAHAM'S MIND A MAZE OF MEMORIES FLUCTUATING PICTURES OF SWATHED HALLS AND CROWDED VAULTS SEEN THROUGH CLOUDS OF DUST OF INTRICATE MACHINES THE RACING THREADS OF LOOMS THE HEAVY BEAT OF STAMPING MACHINERY
2893-139322-0039 THEY EMERGED FROM THESE WANDERINGS AND STOOD BLINKING IN THE BRIGHT LIGHT OF THE MIDDLE PASSAGE OF THE PLATFORMS AGAIN THEY BECAME AWARE OF THE REMOTE HOOTING AND YELPING OF THE MACHINES OF ONE OF THE GENERAL INTELLIGENCE OFFICES
2910-131096-0000 A CERTAIN KING AND QUEEN HAD THREE DAUGHTERS THE CHARMS OF THE TWO ELDER WERE MORE THAN COMMON BUT THE BEAUTY OF THE YOUNGEST WAS SO WONDERFUL THAT THE POVERTY OF LANGUAGE IS UNABLE TO EXPRESS ITS DUE PRAISE THE FAME OF HER BEAUTY WAS SO GREAT
2910-131096-0007 THERE ARE TWO FOUNTAINS IN VENUS'S GARDEN ONE OF SWEET WATERS THE OTHER OF BITTER CUPID FILLED TWO AMBER VASES ONE FROM EACH FOUNTAIN AND SUSPENDING THEM FROM THE TOP OF HIS QUIVER HASTENED TO THE CHAMBER OF PSYCHE WHOM HE FOUND ASLEEP
2910-131096-0014 YOU SHOULD RATHER HAVE GRIEVED WHEN THE PEOPLE SHOWERED UPON ME UNDESERVED HONORS AND WITH ONE VOICE CALLED ME A VENUS I NOW PERCEIVE THAT I AM A VICTIM TO THAT NAME I SUBMIT LEAD ME TO THAT ROCK TO WHICH MY UNHAPPY FATE HAS DESTINED ME
2910-131096-0028 BUT AT LENGTH THE THOUGHT OF HER PARENTS LEFT IN IGNORANCE OF HER FATE
2910-131096-0035 THE INHABITANTS OF THIS VALLEY SAY THAT YOUR HUSBAND IS A TERRIBLE AND MONSTROUS SERPENT WHO NOURISHES YOU FOR A WHILE WITH DAINTIES THAT HE MAY BY AND BY DEVOUR YOU TAKE OUR ADVICE PROVIDE YOURSELF WITH A LAMP AND A SHARP KNIFE
2910-131096-0042 BUT GO RETURN TO YOUR SISTERS WHOSE ADVICE YOU SEEM TO THINK PREFERABLE TO MINE I INFLICT NO OTHER PUNISHMENT ON YOU THAN TO LEAVE YOU FOREVER LOVE CANNOT DWELL WITH SUSPICION SO SAYING HE FLED AWAY LEAVING POOR PSYCHE PROSTRATE ON THE GROUND
2910-131096-0056 APPROACHED THE HEAP AND WITH THE UTMOST DILIGENCE TAKING GRAIN BY GRAIN THEY SEPARATED THE PILE SORTING EACH KIND TO ITS PARCEL AND WHEN IT WAS ALL DONE THEY VANISHED OUT OF SIGHT IN A MOMENT
2910-131096-0063 AND BY OBSERVING HIS DIRECTIONS SHE SOON RETURNED TO VENUS WITH HER ARMS FULL OF THE GOLDEN FLEECE BUT SHE RECEIVED NOT THE APPROBATION OF HER IMPLACABLE MISTRESS WHO SAID I KNOW VERY WELL IT IS BY NONE OF YOUR OWN DOINGS THAT YOU HAVE SUCCEEDED IN THIS TASK
2910-131096-0070 PSYCHE ENCOURAGED BY THIS ADVICE OBEYED IT IN ALL THINGS AND TAKING HEED TO HER WAYS TRAVELLED SAFELY TO THE KINGDOM OF PLUTO SHE WAS ADMITTED TO THE PALACE OF PROSERPINE
2910-131096-0084 AFTER HER WANDERING LABORS LONG TILL FREE CONSENT THE GODS AMONG MAKE HER HIS ETERNAL BRIDE AND FROM HER FAIR UNSPOTTED SIDE TWO BLISSFUL TWINS ARE TO BE BORN YOUTH AND JOY SO JOVE HATH SWORN
2910-131096-0091 O LATEST BORN AND LOVELIEST VISION FAR OF ALL OLYMPUS FADED HIERARCHY FAIRER THAN PHOEBE'S SAPPHIRE REGIONED STAR OR VESPER AMOROUS GLOW WORM OF THE SKY FAIRER THAN THESE THOUGH TEMPLE THOU HAST NONE

2911-12359-0017 WITH OLOROSO SHERRY BLUE LEICESTER WITH OLD VINTAGE PORT GREEN ROQUEFORT WITH NEW VINTAGE PORT TO THESE WE MIGHT ADD BRITTLE CHIPS
2911-12359-0024 FARMERS ALSO DRINK HOMEMADE CIDER
2911-15045-0005 NEW BRUNSWICK NOVA SCOTIA AND LOWER CANADA WERE OCCUPIED SO FAR AS OCCUPIED AT ALL BY TRIBES SPEAKING VARIOUS ALGONQUIN LANGUAGES AND DIALECTS THEY EXTENDED MOREOVER ALONG THE SHORES OF THE UPPER LAKES
2911-15045-0018 THEIR ORDINARY SUSTENANCE WAS DERIVED FROM THE CHASE THOUGH OFTEN GOADED BY DEADLY FAMINE THEY WOULD SUBSIST ON ROOTS THE BARK AND BUDS OF TREES
2911-15045-0025 TO THE NORTH OF THE RIVER THERE WAS INDEED A SMALL ALGONQUIN BAND CALLED LA PETITE NATION TOGETHER WITH ONE OR TWO OTHER FEEBLE COMMUNITIES BUT THEY DWELT FAR FROM THE BANKS THROUGH FEAR OF THE UBIQUITOUS IROQUOIS
2911-15084-0002 ABOUT TWENTY IN NUMBER SEVERAL SOON FELL VICTIMS TO FAMINE
2911-7601-0002 I HEARD MANY THINGS IN HELL HOW THEN AM I MAD HEARKEN AND OBSERVE HOW HEALTHILY HOW CALMLY I CAN TELL YOU THE WHOLE STORY IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY HOW FIRST THE IDEA ENTERED MY BRAIN BUT ONCE CONCEIVED
2911-7601-0009 SO FAR THAT I COULD SEE HIM AS HE LAY UPON HIS BED HA WOULD A MADMAN HAVE BEEN SO WISE AS THIS AND THEN WHEN MY HEAD WAS WELL IN THE ROOM I UNDID THE LANTERN CAUTIOUSLY OH SO CAUTIOUSLY
2911-7601-0016 FOR A WHOLE HOUR I DID NOT MOVE A MUSCLE AND IN THE MEANTIME I DID NOT HEAR HIM LIE DOWN HE WAS STILL SITTING UP IN THE BED LISTENING JUST AS I HAVE DONE NIGHT AFTER NIGHT HEARKENING TO THE DEATH WATCHES IN THE WALL
2911-7601-0030 MEANTIME THE HELLISH TATTOO OF THE HEART INCREASED IT GREW QUICKER AND QUICKER AND LOUDER AND LOUDER EVERY INSTANT THE OLD MAN'S TERROR MUST HAVE BEEN EXTREME IT GREW LOUDER I SAY LOUDER EVERY MOMENT
2911-7601-0037 AND DEPOSITED ALL BETWEEN THE SCANTLINGS I THEN REPLACED THE BOARDS SO CLEVERLY SO CUNNINGLY THAT NO HUMAN EYE NOT EVEN HIS COULD HAVE DETECTED ANY THING WRONG THERE WAS NOTHING TO WASH OUT NO STAIN OF ANY KIND
2911-7601-0044 THEY CHATTED OF FAMILIAR THINGS BUT ERE LONG I FELT MYSELF GETTING PALE AND WISHED THEM GONE MY HEAD ACHED AND I FANCIED A RINGING IN MY EARS BUT STILL THEY SAT AND STILL CHATTED THE RINGING BECAME MORE DISTINCT IT CONTINUED
2952-407-0006 OF COURSE EVERYBODY HEARD OF THE MATTER AND EVERYBODY SOON KNEW WHOSE MIRROR IT WAS THAT WOULD NOT MELT AND BECAUSE OF THIS PUBLIC EXPOSURE OF HER SECRET FAULT THE POOR WOMAN BECAME VERY MUCH ASHAMED AND VERY ANGRY AND AS SHE COULD NOT BEAR THE SHAME SHE DROWNED HERSELF
2952-407-0013 FOR EXAMPLE YOU CANNOT AFFORD TO BUILD A BUDDHIST TEMPLE BUT YOU CAN EASILY LAY A PEBBLE BEFORE THE IMAGE OF THE BUDDHA WITH THE SAME PIOUS FEELING THAT WOULD PROMPT YOU TO BUILD A TEMPLE IF YOU WERE RICH ENOUGH TO BUILD ONE THE MERIT OF SO OFFERING THE PEBBLE BECOMES EQUAL OR ALMOST EQUAL TO THE MERIT OF ERECTING A TEMPLE
2952-407-0020 BUT PERSONS WHO REGRETTED THIS LOSS OF OPPORTUNITY WOULD STRIKE AND BREAK OBJECTS IMAGINATIVELY SUBSTITUTED FOR THE BELL THUS HOPING TO PLEASE THE SPIRIT OF THE OWNER OF THE MIRROR THAT HAD MADE SO MUCH TROUBLE ONE OF THESE PERSONS WAS A WOMAN CALLED UMEGAE
2952-408-0006 STRANGE THINGS ALWAYS HAPPEN IN THE HOUSE WHERE A CORPSE HAS THUS BEEN LEFT SO WE THINK THAT IT WILL BE BETTER FOR YOU TO COME AWAY WITH US WE CAN FIND YOU GOOD LODGING IN THE OTHER VILLAGE
2952-408-0013 BUT WHEN THE HUSH OF THE NIGHT WAS AT ITS DEEPEST THERE NOISELESSLY ENTERED A SHAPE VAGUE AND VAST AND IN THE SAME MOMENT MUSO FOUND HIMSELF WITHOUT POWER TO MOVE OR SPEAK
2952-408-0020 WHAT YOU HAVE TOLD US REVEREND SIR AGREES WITH WHAT HAS BEEN SAID ABOUT THIS MATTER FROM ANCIENT TIME MUSO THEN INQUIRED DOES NOT THE PRIEST ON THE HILL SOMETIMES PERFORM THE FUNERAL SERVICE FOR YOUR DEAD WHAT PRIEST THE YOUNG MAN ASKED
2952-410-0004 HE HAD ALWAYS WELCOMED DISCOMFORT AND EVEN A BARE ROCK WAS FOR HIM A GOOD BED WHEN NOTHING BETTER COULD BE FOUND AND THE ROOT OF A PINE TREE AN EXCELLENT PILLOW HIS BODY WAS IRON AND HE NEVER TROUBLED HIMSELF ABOUT DEWS OR RAIN OR FROST OR SNOW
2952-410-0011 ACCEPTED THIS MODEST OFFER THE WOODCUTTER GUIDED HIM ALONG A NARROW PATH LEADING UP FROM THE MAIN ROAD THROUGH MOUNTAIN FOREST IT WAS A ROUGH AND DANGEROUS PATH SOMETIMES SKIRTING PRECIPICES SOMETIMES OFFERING NOTHING BUT A NETWORK OF
2952-410-0018 KWAIRYO WAS PLEASED BY THIS ANNOUNCEMENT OF GOOD RESOLVE AND HE SAID TO THE ARUJI MY FRIEND I HAVE HAD OCCASION TO OBSERVE THAT MAN PRONE TO FOLLY IN THEIR YOUTH MAY IN AFTER YEARS BECOME VERY EARNEST IN RIGHT LIVING
2952-410-0032 ANOTHER HEAD THE HEAD OF A YOUNG WOMAN IMMEDIATELY ROSE UP AND FLITTED TO THE HOUSE LIGHTLY AS A BAT AFTER A FEW MINUTES IT CAME BACK AND CRIED OUT HUSKILY IN A TONE OF GREAT ALARM THAT TRAVELING PRIEST IS NOT IN THE HOUSE HE IS GONE BUT THAT IS NOT THE WORST OF THE MATTER
2952-410-0039 WITH THEIR BRUISED AND BLEEDING HEADS REUNITED TO THEIR BODIES BUT WHEN THEY PERCEIVED HIM AT THE BACK DOOR ALL SCREAMED THE PRIEST THE PRIEST AND FLED THROUGH THE OTHER DOORWAY OUT INTO THE WOODS EASTWARD THE SKY WAS BRIGHTENING DAY WAS ABOUT TO DAWN
2952-410-0046 A VERY OLD MAN THIS AGED OFFICER HAD MADE NO REMARK DURING THE TRIAL BUT AFTER HAVING HEARD THE OPINION OF HIS COLLEAGUES HE ROSE UP AND SAID LET US FIRST EXAMINE THE HEAD CAREFULLY FOR THIS I THINK HAS NOT YET BEEN DONE
2952-410-0060 AND HE COULD NOT DISCOVER THE BODY THEREFORE HE BURIED THE HEAD BY ITSELF IN THE GROVE BEHIND THE COTTAGE AND HE HAD A TOMBSTONE SET UP OVER THE GRAVE AND HE CAUSED A SEGAKI SERVICE TO BE PERFORMED ON BEHALF OF THE SPIRIT OF THE ROKURO KUBI
298-126790-0006 MISS PEYTON WAS LOOKING FROM A WINDOW IN THE DIRECTION OF THE TENEMENT OF THE PEDDLER AND WAS EXPRESSING A KIND ANXIETY AFTER THE WELFARE OF THE SICK MAN WHEN THE PERSON OF KATY SUDDENLY EMERGED FROM THE DENSE COVERING OF AN EARTHLY CLOUD WHOSE MISTS WERE SCATTERING BEFORE THE CHEERING RAYS OF THE SUN
298-126790-0013 THE COUNTENANCE OF KATY CHANGED FROM THE NATURAL EXPRESSION OF CONCERN TO THE SET FORM OF MELANCHOLY AS SHE ANSWERED HE IS HAPPILY REMOVED FROM THE CARES OF THE WORLD THE CHINKING OF THE MONEY MADE HIM GET OUT OF HIS BED AND THE POOR SOUL FOUND THE SHOCK TOO GREAT FOR HIM
298-126790-0026 AND FEARFUL THE CONVERSATION WOULD CEASE HE INQUIRED WITH AN APPEARANCE OF GREAT INTEREST YOU THINK IT WAS AGE AND DEBILITY THAT REMOVED THE OLD GENTLEMAN AT LAST AND THE TROUBLESOME TIMES TROUBLE IS A HEAVY PULL DOWN TO A SICK BED
298-126790-0040 HARVEY IS AS OBSTINATE ABOUT SUCH THINGS AS A DUMB BEAST ONE WOULD THINK THE CARE I TOOK OF HIS BEDRIDDEN FATHER MIGHT LEARN HIM BETTER THAN TO DESPISE GOOD NURSING BUT SOME DAY HE MAY KNOW WHAT IT IS TO WANT A CAREFUL WOMAN IN HIS HOUSE THOUGH NOW I AM SURE HE IS TOO DESPISABLE HIMSELF TO HAVE A HOUSE
298-126791-0009 HIS PATIENT SMILED AS HE GENTLY REPULSED HIS PHYSICIAN IN AN ATTEMPT TO UNDO THE BANDAGES AND WITH A RETURNING GLOW TO HIS CHEEKS INQUIRED
298-126791-0016 FROM ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE FAMILY WHEN HE MADE HIS MORNING ENTRANCE BUT AN INVISIBLE SPIRIT PRESIDED OVER THE COMFORTS OF THE ENGLISH COLONEL SARAH HAD SHRUNK WITH CONSCIOUSNESS FROM ENTERING THE ROOM YET SHE KNEW THE POSITION OF EVERY GLASS AND HAD WITH HER OWN HANDS SUPPLIED THE CONTENTS OF EVERY BOWL THAT STOOD ON HIS TABLE
298-126791-0023 THE SISTERS THEN SOUGHT THE FRESH AIR ON THE PIAZZA AND AS THEY PURSUED THEIR WALK ARM IN ARM THE FOLLOWING DIALOGUE TOOK PLACE THERE IS SOMETHING DISAGREEABLE ABOUT THIS SURGEON OF DUNWOODIE SAID SARAH THAT CAUSES ME TO WISH HIM AWAY MOST HEARTILY
298-126791-0037 THE FEELING WAS COMMUNICATED TO ALL THE SPECTATORS AND THEY DISPERSED IN PURSUIT OF THEIR USUAL AVOCATIONS ISABELLA YIELDED TO THE GENTLE INFLUENCE OF FRANCES WITHOUT RESISTANCE
298-126791-0044 HE HAS SPENT THE NIGHT IN BRINGING ME A NURSE WHOSE PRESENCE ALONE IS ABLE TO RAISE ME FROM MY COUCH THE EXPRESSION OF THE LADY'S COUNTENANCE CHANGED
298-126791-0051 THAT IS A QUESTION THE MAJOR CAN ANSWER BEST BUT YOU KNOW THE REDCOATS ARE ABROAD AND DUNWOODIE COMMANDS IN THE COUNTY THESE ENGLISH MUST BE LOOKED TO TRUE SAID SINGLETON SLOWLY AS IF STRUCK WITH THE OTHER'S REASONS BUT HOW IS IT THAT YOU ARE IDLE WHEN THERE IS WORK TO DO
298-126791-0065 YES SAID THE OTHER SENDING THE SECOND SLIPPER AFTER THE FIRST AND THIS MAJOR DUNWOODIE NEVER OVERLOOKS AN ADVANTAGE I THINK IF WE HAD THE THING TO DO OVER AGAIN CONTINUED THE COLONEL RAISING HIMSELF ON HIS FEET WE MIGHT ALTER THE CASE VERY MATERIALLY THOUGH THE CHIEF THING THE REBELS HAVE NOW TO BOAST OF IS MY CAPTURE
2989-138028-0004 TO SET OFF THE DIGNITY OF THE PRINCE AND FOR THE GREATER GLORY OF THE KING'S MAJESTY THEN MIGHT NOT YOUR WORSHIP SAID SHE BE ONE OF THOSE THAT WITHOUT STIRRING A STEP SERVE THEIR KING AND LORD IN HIS COURT
2989-138028-0011 AND GLOWING BRIGHTER THAN A GLASS FURNACE MUST NOT ON ANY ACCOUNT BE DISMAYED BY THEM ON THE CONTRARY HE MUST ATTACK AND FALL UPON THEM WITH A GALLANT BEARING AND A FEARLESS HEART AND IF POSSIBLE VANQUISH AND DESTROY THEM EVEN THOUGH THEY HAVE FOR ARMOUR THE SHELLS OF A CERTAIN FISH
2989-138028-0025 FOR IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE NOW TO FIND ONE OF THEIR DESCENDANTS AND EVEN SHOULD WE FIND ONE IT WOULD BE IN SOME LOWLY AND HUMBLE CONDITION OF PLEBEIAN LINEAGES I HAVE NOTHING TO SAY SAVE THAT THEY MERELY SERVE TO SWELL THE NUMBER OF THOSE THAT LIVE
2989-138028-0032 I KNOW TOO THE INFINITE BLESSINGS THAT ARE ATTAINED BY IT I KNOW THAT THE PATH OF VIRTUE IS VERY NARROW AND THE ROAD OF VICE BROAD AND SPACIOUS I KNOW THEIR ENDS AND GOALS ARE DIFFERENT FOR THE BROAD AND EASY ROAD OF VICE ENDS IN DEATH
2989-138028-0039 SAY THE PRAYER OF SANTA APOLLONIA THAT IS IF YOU KNOW IT FOR I WILL COME PRESENTLY AND YOU WILL SEE MIRACLES WOE IS ME CRIED THE HOUSEKEEPER
2989-138028-0053 PLEASE TO RETURN TO MY SERVICE WELL AND GOOD BUT TO SUPPOSE THAT I AM GOING TO DISTURB OR UNHINGE THE ANCIENT USAGE OF KNIGHT ERRANTRY IS ALL NONSENSE AND SO MY SANCHO GET YOU BACK TO YOUR HOUSE AND EXPLAIN MY INTENTIONS TO YOUR TERESA
2989-138028-0060 OF THE HONOUR OF VIRGINS OF THE AID OF WIDOWS AND OF THE SUPPORT OF WIVES AND OTHER MATTERS OF THIS KIND APPERTAINING BELONGING PROPER AND PECULIAR
2989-138028-0067 AND SO THERE'S NOTHING MORE TO DO BUT FOR YOUR WORSHIP TO MAKE YOUR WILL WITH ITS CODICIL IN SUCH A WAY THAT IT CAN'T BE PROVOKED
2989-138035-0005 WHO IS CALLED PAR EXCELLENCE
2989-138035-0012 HE ARRANGED A MATCH FOR HIS DAUGHTER WITH THE RICH CAMACHO
2989-138035-0019 AND THE MATRIMONIAL CHOICE IS VERY LIABLE TO ERROR
2989-138035-0033 WHERE YOU ARE NOW TAIL LOOK HERE BACHELOR CORCHUELO RETURNED THE LICENTIATE YOU HAVE THE MOST MISTAKEN IDEA IN THE WORLD ABOUT SKILL WITH THE SWORD IF YOU THINK IT USELESS IT IS NO IDEA ON MY PART BUT AN ESTABLISHED TRUTH
2989-138035-0040 BY MY FAITH SENOR BACHELOR IF YOUR WORSHIP TAKES MY ADVICE YOU WILL NEVER CHALLENGE ANYONE TO FENCE AGAIN ONLY TO WRESTLE AND THROW THE BAR FOR YOU HAVE THE YOUTH AND STRENGTH FOR THAT BUT AS FOR THESE FENCERS AS THEY CALL THEM I HAVE HEARD SAY
2989-138035-0047 OTHERS SINGING OTHERS PLAYING THE VARIOUS INSTRUMENTS ALREADY MENTIONED
2989-138035-0060 SENOR IT'S MY OPINION THE POOR MAN SHOULD BE CONTENT WITH WHAT HE CAN GET
2989-138035-0067 THEY SWALLOWED UP WHOLE SHEEP AND HID THEM AWAY IN THEIR INSIDES WITHOUT SHOWING ANY MORE SIGN OF THEM THAN IF THEY WERE PIGEONS
2989-138035-0074 GET DOWN AND LOOK ABOUT FOR A LADLE AND SKIM OFF A HEN OR TWO AND MUCH GOOD MAY THEY DO YOU I DON'T SEE ONE SAID SANCHO WAIT A BIT SAID THE COOK SINNER THAT I AM HOW PARTICULAR AND BASHFUL YOU ARE
302-123504-0009 WHERE I MOMENTARILY EXPECTED THE FORMER TO FALL LIMP AT THE END OF A BROKEN NECK IN ACCOMPLISHING THIS THE APE WAS TEARING AWAY THE ENTIRE FRONT OF ITS BREAST WHICH WAS HELD IN THE VISE LIKE GRIP OF THE POWERFUL JAWS
302-123504-0016 AGAINST THE IRON MUSCLES AND BRUTAL FEROCITY OF THIS ENRAGED DENIZEN OF AN UNKNOWN WORLD IN FACT THE ONLY OUTCOME OF SUCH AN ENCOUNTER SO FAR AS I MIGHT BE CONCERNED SEEMED SUDDEN DEATH
302-123504-0023 SO I MERELY THREW IT AS HEAVILY AS I COULD AT HIS ADVANCING BULK IT STRUCK HIM JUST BELOW THE KNEES ELICITING A HOWL OF PAIN AND RAGE AND SO THROWING HIM OFF HIS BALANCE THAT HE LUNGED FULL UPON ME
302-123504-0037 HELD IN ITS POOR UGLY CARCASS MORE LOVE MORE LOYALTY MORE GRATITUDE
302-123516-0006 I WAS STRAPPED SECURELY TO AS WILD AND UNMANAGEABLE A THOAT AS I HAD EVER SEEN AND WITH A MOUNTED WARRIOR ON EITHER SIDE TO PREVENT THE BEAST FROM BOLTING
302-123516-0013 WITH EMPHASIS AND DIGNITY IF AT ALL ROARED DAK KOVA BY THE DEAD HANDS AT MY THROAT BUT HE SHALL DIE BAR COMAS NO MAUDLIN WEAKNESS ON YOUR PART SHALL SAVE HIM
302-123516-0027 AND IN THE DARKNESS I OCCASIONALLY CAUGHT GLIMPSES OF GLEAMING FIERY EYES FIXED IN HORRIBLE INTENTNESS UPON ME NO SOUND REACHED ME FROM THE WORLD ABOVE AND NO WORD WOULD MY JAILER VOUCHSAFE WHEN MY FOOD WAS BROUGHT TO ME
302-123516-0034 BACK INTO MY CORNER I CROUCHED
302-123523-0005 SURROUNDED BY OFFICERS AND DIGNITARIES OF STATE BEFORE THEM STRETCHED A BROAD AISLE LINED ON EITHER SIDE WITH SOLDIERY AND AS I LOOKED THERE ENTERED THIS AISLE AT THE FAR END OF THE HALL
302-123523-0019 WHEN SEVERAL MORE RUSHED TO THE AID OF THEIR NEW RULER AND TO AVENGE THE DEATH OF THE OLD AS THEY ADVANCED THERE WERE CRIES OF THE WOMAN THE WOMAN STRIKE HER DOWN IT IS HER PLOT KILL HER KILL HER
302-123523-0026 I CALLED KANTOS KAN'S NAME ALOUD IN EACH NEW CORRIDOR AND COMPARTMENT AND FINALLY I WAS REWARDED BY HEARING A FAINT RESPONSE GUIDED BY THE SOUND WE SOON FOUND HIM HELPLESS IN A DARK RECESS
302-123523-0033 LOVE FOR DEJAH THORIS A POWER THAT WOULD WORK GREATER MIRACLES THAN THIS YOU HAVE SEEN A PRETTY FLUSH OVERSPREAD HER FACE AND SHE ANSWERED YOU MAY SAY THAT NOW JOHN CARTER AND I MAY LISTEN
307-127535-0008 YOU'LL ALL SWING NOW I RECKON WHAT SOFT HEADED LUBBER HAD A BIBLE IT WAS DICK SAID ONE DICK WAS IT THEN DICK CAN GET TO PRAYERS SAID SILVER
307-127535-0015 THIRD YOU WOULDN'T LET US GO AT THEM UPON THE MARCH
307-127535-0022 BUT THIS TOPS THE STIFFEST YARN TO NOTHING SILVER PAUSED AND I COULD SEE BY THE FACES OF GEORGE AND HIS LATE COMRADES THAT THESE WORDS HAD NOT BEEN SAID IN VAIN THAT'S FOR NUMBER ONE
307-127535-0036 SO THAT'S THE TOON IS IT CRIED THE COOK GEORGE I RECKON YOU'LL HAVE TO WAIT ANOTHER TURN FRIEND AND LUCKY FOR YOU AS I'M NOT A REVENGEFUL MAN BUT
307-127535-0043 IT WAS LONG ERE I COULD CLOSE AN EYE AND HEAVEN KNOWS I HAD MATTER ENOUGH FOR THOUGHT IN THE MAN WHOM I HAD SLAIN THAT AFTERNOON
307-127539-0004 AND TO DIG WITH THEIR FINGERS THROWING THE BOARDS ASIDE AS THEY DID SO MORGAN FOUND A PIECE OF GOLD HE HELD IT UP WITH A PERFECT SPOUT OF OATHS IT WAS A TWO GUINEA PIECE AND IT WENT FROM HAND TO HAND AMONG THEM FOR A QUARTER OF A MINUTE
307-127539-0018 WE WERE ALREADY BETWEEN THEM AND THE BOATS
307-127539-0025 AND KEEP A GUARD UPON THE MONEY AS FOR YOU JIM HE SAID IT WENT AGAINST MY HEART
307-127539-0032 ANOTHER ANCHOR WAS GOT READY AND DROPPED IN A FATHOM AND A HALF OF WATER WE ALL PULLED ROUND AGAIN TO RUM COVE THE NEAREST POINT FOR BEN GUNN'S TREASURE HOUSE AND THEN GRAY SINGLE HANDED RETURNED WITH THE GIG TO THE HISPANIOLA
307-127540-0003 THE PICTURES OF ALL THE KINGS OF EUROPE FOR THE LAST HUNDRED YEARS STRANGE ORIENTAL PIECES STAMPED WITH WHAT LOOKED LIKE WISPS OF STRING OR BITS OF SPIDER'S WEB
307-127540-0017 AND TO TAKE THEM HOME FOR THE GIBBET WOULD HAVE BEEN A CRUEL SORT OF KINDNESS THE DOCTOR HAILED THEM AND TOLD THEM OF THE STORES WE HAD LEFT AND WHERE THEY WERE TO FIND THEM BUT THEY CONTINUED TO CALL US BY NAME AND APPEAL TO US FOR GOD'S SAKE
307-127540-0031 MARRIED BESIDES AND THE FATHER OF A FAMILY AS FOR BEN GUNN HE GOT A THOUSAND POUNDS WHICH HE SPENT OR LOST IN THREE WEEKS OR TO BE MORE EXACT IN NINETEEN DAYS FOR HE WAS BACK BEGGING ON THE TWENTIETH
311-124404-0002 I HAVE EVER REMAINED FIRM IN MY ORIGINAL RESOLUTION TO SUPPOSE NO OTHER PRINCIPLE THAN THAT OF WHICH I HAVE RECENTLY AVAILED MYSELF IN DEMONSTRATING THE EXISTENCE OF GOD AND OF THE SOUL
311-124404-0009 ON ALL THE BODIES THAT ARE UPON THE EARTH SINCE THEY ARE EITHER COLORED OR TRANSPARENT OR LUMINOUS AND FINALLY ON MAN SINCE HE IS THE SPECTATOR OF THESE OBJECTS
311-124404-0023 TO THAT OBSERVED IN OUR SEAS AS ALSO A CERTAIN CURRENT BOTH OF WATER AND AIR FROM EAST TO WEST SUCH AS IS LIKEWISE OBSERVED BETWEEN THE TROPICS HOW THE MOUNTAINS SEAS FOUNTAINS AND RIVERS MIGHT NATURALLY BE FORMED IN IT
311-124404-0030 BUT THIS IS CERTAIN AND AN OPINION COMMONLY RECEIVED AMONG THEOLOGIANS THAT THE ACTION BY WHICH HE NOW SUSTAINS IT IS THE SAME WITH THAT BY WHICH HE ORIGINALLY CREATED IT
311-124404-0037 AND WHICH I THOUGHT WAS NOT DIFFERENT FROM THE HEAT IN HAY THAT HAS BEEN HEAPED TOGETHER BEFORE IT IS DRY OR THAT WHICH CAUSES FERMENTATION IN NEW WINES BEFORE THEY ARE RUN CLEAR OF THE FRUIT FOR WHEN I EXAMINED THE KIND OF FUNCTIONS WHICH MIGHT
311-124404-0051 TWO OTHERS AT THE MOUTH OF THE VENOUS ARTERY WHICH ALLOW THE BLOOD FROM THE LUNGS TO FLOW INTO THE LEFT CAVITY OF THE HEART BUT PRECLUDE ITS RETURN AND THREE AT THE MOUTH OF THE GREAT ARTERY WHICH SUFFER THE BLOOD TO FLOW FROM THE HEART
311-124404-0058 BECAUSE THE ORIFICES THROUGH WHICH THEY PASS ARE WIDE
311-124404-0065 IT THENCE HAPPENS THAT THEIR MOTION IS THE CONTRARY OF THAT OF THE HEART AND THAT WHEN IT EXPANDS THEY CONTRACT BUT LEST THOSE WHO ARE IGNORANT OF THE FORCE OF MATHEMATICAL DEMONSTRATIONS AND WHO ARE NOT ACCUSTOMED TO DISTINGUISH
311-124404-0079 AND IF ATTENTION BE GIVEN IT WILL BE FOUND THAT THIS DIFFERENCE IS VERY MARKED ONLY IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF THE HEART
311-124404-0086 AND THE PRODUCTION OF THE DIFFERENT HUMORS OF THE BODY BEYOND SAYING THAT THE FORCE WITH WHICH THE BLOOD IN BEING RAREFIED PASSES FROM THE HEART TOWARDS THE EXTREMITIES OF THE ARTERIES CAUSES CERTAIN OF ITS PARTS TO REMAIN IN THE MEMBERS AT WHICH THEY ARRIVE
311-124404-0093 WHICH FLOW FORTH FROM THE LEFT CAVITY OF THE HEART AND TEND TOWARDS THE BRAIN THE WEAKER AND LESS AGITATED PARTS MUST NECESSARILY BE DRIVEN ASIDE FROM THAT POINT BY THE STRONGER WHICH ALONE IN THIS WAY REACH IT
311-124404-0107 THAT THERE ARE NO MEN SO DULL AND STUPID NOT EVEN IDIOTS AS TO BE INCAPABLE OF JOINING TOGETHER DIFFERENT WORDS AND THEREBY CONSTRUCTING A DECLARATION BY WHICH TO MAKE THEIR THOUGHTS UNDERSTOOD
311-124404-0114 THAT THOUGH THERE ARE MANY ANIMALS WHICH MANIFEST MORE INDUSTRY THAN WE IN CERTAIN OF THEIR ACTIONS THE SAME ANIMALS ARE YET OBSERVED TO SHOW NONE AT ALL IN MANY OTHERS SO THAT THE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT THEY DO BETTER
311-124404-0121 BECAUSE NO OTHER CAUSES ARE OBSERVED CAPABLE OF DESTROYING IT
3112-9554-0013 AT THE TIME OF HIS DEATH HE HAD WRITTEN FOUR FIFTHS OF AN IRISH STORY CALLED THE LANDLEAGUERS SHORTLY ABOUT TO BE PUBLISHED AND HE LEFT IN MANUSCRIPT A COMPLETED NOVEL CALLED AN OLD MAN'S LOVE
3112-9554-0020 IN NO OTHER CASE EXCEPT FRAMLEY PARSONAGE DID MY FATHER PUBLISH EVEN THE FIRST NUMBER OF ANY NOVEL BEFORE HE HAD FULLY COMPLETED THE WHOLE TALE
3112-9555-0003 AND YET THE GARRULITY OF OLD AGE AND THE APTITUDE OF A MAN'S MIND TO RECUR TO THE PASSAGES OF HIS OWN LIFE WILL I KNOW TEMPT ME TO SAY SOMETHING OF MYSELF
3112-9555-0017 THEN I WAS SENT TO A PRIVATE SCHOOL AT SUNBURY KEPT BY ARTHUR DRURY THIS I THINK MUST HAVE BEEN DONE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE ADVICE OF HENRY DRURY WHO WAS MY TUTOR AT HARROW SCHOOL AND MY FATHER'S FRIEND
3112-9555-0024 SHOULD ALL BECOME FELLOWS OF NEW COLLEGE BUT THAT SUFFERING MAN WAS NEVER DESTINED TO HAVE AN AMBITION GRATIFIED WE ALL LOST THE PRIZE WHICH HE STRUGGLED WITH INFINITE LABOUR TO PUT WITHIN OUR REACH
3112-9555-0031 I HAVE NO CLEAR KNOWLEDGE OF HER OBJECT OR OF MY FATHER'S BUT I BELIEVE THAT HE HAD AN IDEA THAT MONEY MIGHT BE MADE BY SENDING GOODS LITTLE GOODS SUCH AS PIN CUSHIONS PEPPER BOXES AND POCKET KNIVES OUT TO THE STILL UNFURNISHED STATES
3112-9555-0044 IT IS THE NATURE OF BOYS TO BE CRUEL I HAVE SOMETIMES DOUBTED WHETHER AMONG EACH OTHER THEY DO USUALLY SUFFER MUCH ONE FROM THE OTHER'S CRUELTY BUT I SUFFERED HORRIBLY
3112-9555-0051 WHEN I HAD BEEN AT WINCHESTER SOMETHING OVER THREE YEARS MY FATHER RETURNED TO ENGLAND AND TOOK ME AWAY WHETHER THIS WAS DONE BECAUSE OF THE EXPENSE OR BECAUSE MY CHANCE OF NEW COLLEGE WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE PASSED AWAY
3112-9555-0058 THE ONLY EXPENSE EXCEPT THAT OF BOOKS TO WHICH A HOUSE BOARDER WAS THEN SUBJECT WAS THE FEE TO A TUTOR AMOUNTING I THINK TO TEN GUINEAS MY TUTOR TOOK ME WITHOUT THE FEE
3112-9555-0072 SO THAT IN THE EVENT OF GUILTY FAULT HE MIGHT BE ABLE TO PULL MY HAIR WITHOUT STOPPING HIS RAZOR OR DROPPING HIS SHAVING BRUSH NO FATHER WAS EVER MORE ANXIOUS FOR THE EDUCATION OF HIS CHILDREN
3112-9555-0079 AND WHEN THERE IS A CHARM IN WALKING BUT HERE WERE THE SAME LANES FOUR TIMES A DAY IN WET AND DRY IN HEAT AND SUMMER WITH ALL THE ACCOMPANYING MUD AND DUST AND WITH DISORDERED CLOTHES
3112-9555-0086 AND VERY FORTUNATE IT WAS THAT I DID NOT SUCCEED FOR MY CAREER WITH SUCH ASSISTANCE ONLY AS A SCHOLARSHIP WOULD HAVE GIVEN ME WOULD HAVE ENDED IN DEBT AND IGNOMINY WHEN I LEFT HARROW I WAS ALL BUT NINETEEN
3168-173564-0006 PAID UNCEASING ATTENTION TO HER COUSIN LOOK NATASHA HOW DREADFULLY IT IS BURNING SAID SHE WHAT'S BURNING ASKED NATASHA OH YES MOSCOW
3168-173564-0013 EVIDENTLY DISBELIEVING WHAT THEY TOLD HER AND CONVINCED THAT SAY WHAT SHE MIGHT SHE WOULD STILL BE TOLD THE SAME ALL THE WAY SHE HAD SAT MOTIONLESS IN A CORNER OF THE COACH WITH WIDE OPEN EYES
3168-173564-0020 I'LL LIE DOWN AT ONCE SAID NATASHA AND BEGAN HURRIEDLY UNDRESSING TUGGING AT THE TAPES OF HER PETTICOAT WHEN SHE HAD THROWN OFF HER DRESS AND PUT ON A DRESSING JACKET
3168-173564-0034 WITH HER BARE FEET SHE TOUCHED A SLEEPING MAN STEPPED OVER HIM AND OPENED THE DOOR INTO THE PART OF THE HUT WHERE PRINCE ANDREW LAY IT WAS DARK IN THERE IN THE FARTHEST CORNER ON A BENCH BESIDE A BED
3168-173564-0041 THE VALET SAT UP AND WHISPERED SOMETHING TIMOKHIN KEPT AWAKE BY THE PAIN IN HIS WOUNDED LEG GAZED WITH WIDE OPEN EYES AT THIS STRANGE APPARITION OF A GIRL IN A WHITE
3168-173565-0002 HAD BEEN FAIRLY WARM AND HE HAD REMAINED IN THE CALECHE BUT AT MYTISHCHI THE WOUNDED MAN HIMSELF ASKED TO BE TAKEN OUT AND GIVEN SOME TEA THE PAIN CAUSED BY HIS REMOVAL INTO THE HUT HAD MADE HIM GROAN ALOUD AND AGAIN LOSE CONSCIOUSNESS
3168-173565-0016 AND ABOVE ALL VIVIDLY REMEMBERED THE MOMENT AT THE AMBULANCE STATION WHEN AT THE SIGHT OF THE SUFFERINGS OF A MAN HE DISLIKED THOSE NEW THOUGHTS HAD COME TO HIM WHICH PROMISED HIM HAPPINESS AND THOSE
3168-173565-0023 IT HAD NEVER REACHED WHEN HE WAS IN HEALTH BUT SUDDENLY IN THE MIDST OF ITS WORK IT WOULD TURN TO SOME UNEXPECTED IDEA AND HE HAD NOT THE STRENGTH TO TURN IT BACK AGAIN YES A NEW HAPPINESS WAS REVEALED TO ME OF WHICH MAN CANNOT BE DEPRIVED
3168-173565-0030 HE ALSO SAW BY GLIMPSES A RED HALO ROUND THE CANDLE AND HEARD THE RUSTLE OF THE COCKROACHES AND THE BUZZING OF THE FLY THAT FLOPPED AGAINST HIS PILLOW AND HIS FACE
3168-173565-0044 OH HOW OPPRESSIVE THIS CONTINUAL DELIRIUM IS THOUGHT PRINCE ANDREW TRYING TO DRIVE THAT FACE FROM HIS IMAGINATION BUT THE FACE REMAINED BEFORE HIM WITH THE FORCE OF REALITY AND DREW NEARER
3168-173565-0051 JUST TOUCHING IT LIGHTLY WITH HER LIPS FORGIVE ME SHE WHISPERED RAISING HER HEAD AND GLANCING AT HIM FORGIVE ME I LOVE YOU SAID PRINCE ANDREW
3168-173565-0058 FELL SOBBING ON HER BED FROM THAT TIME DURING ALL THE REST OF THE ROSTOVS JOURNEY AT EVERY HALTING PLACE AND WHEREVER THEY SPENT A NIGHT NATASHA NEVER LEFT THE WOUNDED BOLKONSKI
32-21625-0010 WITH WHICH YOU COULD GNAW RIGHT THROUGH A TREE HE WOULD NOT CARE TO HAVE YOU SEIZE HIM AS HE POKED HIS HEAD AROUND A CORNER IN A DARK PASSAGE OF A STRANGE HOUSE IT WAS IN A HOUSE OF THAT KIND THAT BROWNIE BEAVER LIVED
32-21625-0017 THAN YOU WOULD THINK OF BUILDING ONE IN A POND EVERYBODY LIKES HIS OWN WAY BEST AND IT NEVER ONCE OCCURRED TO BROWNIE BEAVER THAT HIS WAY WAS THE LEAST BIT STRANGE
32-21631-0006 BEING A NEWSPAPER HE THOUGHT HE OUGHT TO SAY NOTHING EXCEPT WHAT WAS NEWS NOT EVEN GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER RABBIT OF PINE RIDGE WITH HIS WIFE AND FOURTEEN CHILDREN IS VISITING HIS BROTHER MISTER JEREMIAH RABBIT
32-21634-0000 THERE WAS GREAT REJOICING IN THE LITTLE VILLAGE IN THE POND WHEN BROWNIE BEAVER RETURNED WITH THE GOOD NEWS THAT THERE WOULD BE NO MORE HUNTING AND FISHING AND WHEN OLD GRANDADDY BEAVER SAID THAT EVERYBODY OUGHT TO TAKE A HOLIDAY TO CELEBRATE THE OCCASION
32-21634-0007 AND MORE DIFFICULT TO GNAW WHILE OTHERS COMPLAINED THAT THE BARK OF THEIR TREES TASTED VERY BITTER AND OF COURSE THAT MADE THEIR TASK UNPLEASANT THOSE SIX TREES FALLING ONE AFTER ANOTHER MADE SUCH A RACKET
32-21634-0014 YOU DON'T SEEM TO HAVE UNDERSTOOD THAT SIGN IN THE FIRST PLACE IT WAS NOT FARMER GREEN BUT HIS SON JOHNNIE WHO NAILED IT TO THE TREE
32-4137-0007 FEW PERSONS CAN ARRIVE AT ANYTHING LIKE THE AGE OF A NEGRO BY MERE OBSERVATION UNLESS THEY ARE WELL ACQUAINTED WITH THE RACE THEREFORE THE SLAVE TRADER VERY FREQUENTLY CARRIED OUT THIS DECEPTION WITH PERFECT IMPUNITY AFTER THE STEAMER HAD LEFT THE WHARF
32-4137-0021 YOU IS NOW TWENTY THREE YEARS OLD AN NO MORE DUS YOU HEAR DAT YES RESPONDED TOBY
32-4137-0035 HE WILL BRING A THOUSAND DOLLARS ANY DAY IN THE NEW ORLEANS MARKET REPLIED SMITH THEN YOU BET THE WHOLE OF THE BOY DO YOU YES I CALL YOU THEN SAID JOHNSON AT THE SAME TIME SPREADING HIS CARDS OUT UPON THE TABLE
32-4137-0042 WHEN I WENT TO SLEEP LAST NIGHT I BELONGED TO GOVERNOR LUCAS BUT I UNDERSTAND DAT HE IS BIN GAMBLING ALL NIGHT SO I DON'T KNOW WHO OWNS ME DIS MORNING SUCH IS THE UNCERTAINTY OF A SLAVE'S POSITION
32-4137-0049 AND THE CLERGYMAN LEFT WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT THE WOMAN SHOULD BE DELIVERED TO HIM AT HIS HOUSE IT SEEMED AS IF POOR ALTHESA WOULD HAVE WEPT HERSELF TO DEATH FOR THE FIRST TWO DAYS AFTER HER MOTHER HAD BEEN TORN FROM HER SIDE BY THE HAND OF THE RUTHLESS TRAFFICKER IN HUMAN FLESH
3214-167602-0004 AND CONTINUED TO IMPART HIS VIEWS HE SAID THE PEASANTS WERE OBDURATE AND THAT AT THE PRESENT MOMENT IT WOULD BE IMPRUDENT TO OVERRESIST THEM WITHOUT AN ARMED FORCE AND WOULD IT NOT BE BETTER FIRST TO SEND FOR THE MILITARY I'LL GIVE THEM ARMED FORCE
3214-167602-0011 SHOUTED ROSTOV COMING UP TO THE CROWD WITH QUICK STEPS THE ELDER
3214-167602-0018 SHOUTED ROSTOV AS IF THAT ORDER TOO COULD NOT POSSIBLY MEET WITH ANY OPPOSITION AND IN FACT TWO MORE PEASANTS BEGAN BINDING DRON WHO TOOK OFF HIS OWN BELT AND HANDED IT TO THEM AS IF TO AID THEM AND YOU ALL LISTEN TO ME SAID ROSTOV TO THE PEASANTS
3214-167602-0032 MORE THAN ONCE NOTICED THAT HER MISTRESS LEANED OUT OF THE WINDOW AND SMILED AT SOMETHING WITH AN EXPRESSION OF MINGLED JOY AND SORROW WELL SUPPOSING I DO LOVE HIM THOUGHT PRINCESS MARY ASHAMED AS SHE WAS OF ACKNOWLEDGING TO HERSELF THAT SHE HAD FALLEN IN LOVE WITH A MAN WHO
3214-167606-0001 ON THE CONTRARY HE WAS GLAD THAT LADIES AND TRADESMEN'S WIVES WERE LEAVING THE CITY THERE WILL BE LESS PANIC AND LESS GOSSIP RAN THE BROADSHEET
3214-167606-0008 THEY NO LONGER OBEY EVEN MY MAID HAS TAKEN TO BEING RUDE AT THIS RATE THEY WILL SOON BEGIN BEATING US ONE CAN'T WALK IN THE STREETS BUT ABOVE ALL THE FRENCH WILL BE HERE ANY DAY NOW SO WHAT ARE WE WAITING FOR I ASK JUST ONE THING OF YOU COUSIN SHE WENT ON
3214-167606-0022 STOPPED AND GOT OUT OF HIS TRAP A FRENCH COOK ACCUSED OF BEING A SPY WAS BEING FLOGGED THE FLOGGING WAS ONLY JUST OVER AND THE EXECUTIONER WAS RELEASING FROM THE FLOGGING BENCH A STOUT MAN WITH RED WHISKERS IN BLUE STOCKINGS AND A GREEN JACKET
3214-167606-0029 AT THE SIGHT OF THE TORTURED FRENCHMAN AND THE CROWD SURROUNDING THE LOBNOE PLACE PIERRE HAD SO DEFINITELY MADE UP HIS MIND THAT HE COULD NO LONGER REMAIN IN MOSCOW AND WOULD LEAVE FOR THE ARMY THAT VERY DAY THAT IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT EITHER
3214-167606-0036 THE COMFORTS OF LIFE WEALTH EVEN LIFE ITSELF IS RUBBISH IT IS PLEASANT TO THROW AWAY COMPARED WITH SOMETHING WITH WHAT PIERRE COULD NOT SAY AND HE DID NOT TRY TO DETERMINE FOR WHOM AND FOR WHAT HE FELT SUCH PARTICULAR DELIGHT IN SACRIFICING EVERYTHING
3214-167607-0013 AT THE VERY PLACE WHERE THE BATTLE WAS FOUGHT IN FRONT OF THIS POSITION THEY SAY A FORTIFIED OUTPOST WAS SET UP ON THE SHEVARDINO MOUND TO OBSERVE THE ENEMY ON THE TWENTY FOURTH WE ARE TOLD NAPOLEON ATTACKED THIS ADVANCED POST AND TOOK IT
3214-167607-0020 AND THAT THOSE BEGUN ON THE TWENTY FIFTH AND TWENTY SIXTH WERE NOT COMPLETED AND SECONDLY BY THE POSITION OF THE SHEVARDINO REDOUBT THAT REDOUBT WAS QUITE SENSELESS IN FRONT OF THE POSITION WHERE THE BATTLE WAS ACCEPTED
3214-167607-0027 BUT WHILE PURSUING THE RUSSIAN REARGUARD HE CAME UPON THE LEFT FLANK OF THE RUSSIAN POSITION AT THE SHEVARDINO REDOUBT AND UNEXPECTEDLY FOR THE RUSSIANS MOVED HIS ARMY ACROSS THE KOLOCHA
322-124146-0000 MISTER COLLINS WAS NOT LEFT LONG TO THE SILENT CONTEMPLATION OF HIS SUCCESSFUL LOVE FOR MISSUS BENNET HAVING DAWDLED ABOUT IN THE VESTIBULE TO WATCH FOR THE END OF THE CONFERENCE NO SOONER SAW ELIZABETH OPEN THE DOOR
322-124146-0007 BUT IF SHE IS REALLY HEADSTRONG AND FOOLISH I KNOW NOT WHETHER SHE WOULD ALTOGETHER BE A VERY DESIRABLE WIFE TO A MAN IN MY SITUATION WHO NATURALLY LOOKS FOR HAPPINESS IN THE MARRIAGE STATE
322-124146-0014 MY DEAR REPLIED HER HUSBAND I HAVE TWO SMALL FAVOURS TO REQUEST FIRST THAT YOU WILL ALLOW ME THE FREE USE OF MY UNDERSTANDING ON THE PRESENT OCCASION AND SECONDLY
322-124146-0028 ELIZABETH PASSED QUIETLY OUT OF THE ROOM JANE AND KITTY FOLLOWED BUT LYDIA STOOD HER GROUND DETERMINED TO HEAR ALL SHE COULD AND CHARLOTTE
322-124146-0035 MY CONDUCT MAY I FEAR BE OBJECTIONABLE IN HAVING ACCEPTED MY DISMISSION FROM YOUR DAUGHTER'S LIPS INSTEAD OF YOUR OWN BUT WE ARE ALL LIABLE TO ERROR
322-124147-0004 AFTER BREAKFAST THE GIRLS WALKED TO MERYTON TO INQUIRE IF MISTER WICKHAM WERE RETURNED AND TO LAMENT OVER HIS ABSENCE FROM THE NETHERFIELD BALL HE JOINED THEM ON THEIR ENTERING THE TOWN
322-124147-0017 WHY WILL YOU THINK SO IT MUST BE HIS OWN DOING HE IS HIS OWN MASTER BUT YOU DO NOT KNOW ALL I WILL READ YOU THE PASSAGE WHICH PARTICULARLY HURTS ME
322-124147-0024 SAID JANE AS SHE FINISHED IT IS IT NOT CLEAR ENOUGH DOES IT NOT EXPRESSLY DECLARE THAT CAROLINE NEITHER EXPECTS NOR WISHES ME TO BE HER SISTER THAT SHE IS PERFECTLY CONVINCED OF HER BROTHER'S INDIFFERENCE
322-124147-0031 THAT BECAUSE MISS BINGLEY TELLS YOU HER BROTHER GREATLY ADMIRES MISS DARCY HE IS IN THE SMALLEST DEGREE LESS SENSIBLE OF YOUR MERIT THAN WHEN HE TOOK LEAVE OF YOU ON TUESDAY OR THAT IT WILL BE IN HER POWER TO PERSUADE HIM THAT INSTEAD OF BEING IN LOVE WITH YOU
322-124147-0045 BY ENGAGING THEM TOWARDS HERSELF SUCH WAS MISS LUCAS'S SCHEME AND APPEARANCES WERE SO FAVOURABLE THAT WHEN THEY PARTED AT NIGHT
322-124147-0052 WHO ACCEPTED HIM SOLELY FROM THE PURE AND DISINTERESTED DESIRE OF AN ESTABLISHMENT CARED NOT HOW SOON THAT ESTABLISHMENT WERE GAINED SIR WILLIAM AND LADY LUCAS WERE SPEEDILY APPLIED TO FOR THEIR CONSENT
322-124147-0059 AND HOWEVER UNCERTAIN OF GIVING HAPPINESS MUST BE THEIR PLEASANTEST PRESERVATIVE FROM WANT THIS PRESERVATIVE SHE HAD NOW OBTAINED AND AT THE AGE OF TWENTY SEVEN
322-124147-0073 THERE WAS A SOLIDITY IN HIS REFLECTIONS WHICH OFTEN STRUCK HER AND THOUGH BY NO MEANS SO CLEVER AS HERSELF SHE THOUGHT THAT IF ENCOURAGED TO READ AND IMPROVE HIMSELF BY SUCH AN EXAMPLE AS HERS
322-124147-0080 I HOPE YOU WILL BE SATISFIED WITH WHAT I HAVE DONE I AM NOT ROMANTIC YOU KNOW I NEVER WAS I ASK ONLY A COMFORTABLE HOME AND CONSIDERING MISTER COLLINS'S CHARACTER
3235-11599-0003 TWO ESSENTIAL CHARACTERISTICS ARE INVOLVED IN THE ORDINARY MUSICAL MEASURE ONE A GROUP OF EVEN BEATS OR PULSES ALWAYS FELT THOUGH NOT ALWAYS ACTUALLY SOUNDED
3235-11599-0017 OR WHETHER IT IS A VARIETY COMPOUNDED OUT OF TWO BEAT MEASURES EITHER BY PLACING TWO OF THESE IN A GROUP OR BY THE ELABORATION OF A SINGLE MEASURE INTO A LARGER NUMBER OF BEATS AS IS OFTEN NECESSARY IN SLOW TEMPI
3235-11599-0024 BUT THESE ARE PRACTICALLY ALWAYS TAKEN AS THREE BEAT AND FOUR BEAT MEASURES RESPECTIVELY BEING EQUIVALENT TO THESE IF EACH GROUP OF THREE TONES IS THOUGHT OF AS A TRIPLET
3235-28433-0002 TENTS AND BEDDING SUFFICIENT TO LAST UNTIL SOME OF OUR NUMEROUS PLANS OF WORK AFTER OUR ARRIVAL BROUGHT IN RETURNS MY HOPE WAS TO MEET MY FATHER THERE FOR HE HAD WRITTEN THAT HE THOUGHT HE SHOULD GO TO THE NEW GOLD FIELDS
3235-28433-0016 ONE A ZEALOUS YOUNG WOMAN FROM SAN FRANCISCO GOING TO THE SWEDISH MISSION AT GOLOVIN BAY THIS YOUNG PERSON WAS PRETTY AND PLEASANT AND I WAS GLAD TO MAKE HER ACQUAINTANCE AS WELL AS THAT OF THREE OTHER WOMEN SPEAKING THE SAME TONGUE
3235-28433-0023 WITH THE HELP OF SEVERAL SINGERS ON BOARD GAVE CONCERTS IN THE DINING SALON WHICH THOUGH IMPROMPTU WERE VERY ENJOYABLE A SWEET AND TRAINED SINGER WAS THE ENGLISH GIRL OF OUR COMPANY
3235-28433-0030 AND HOPED THEY WOULD IF THAT WOULD PUT AN END TO THEIR SUFFERINGS WE TRIED AT LAST TO GIVE THEM COMFORT BY RECOMMENDING OUT OF FORMER EXPERIENCES SHIP'S BISCUIT DRY TOAST AND POP CORN AS REMEDIES
3235-28433-0044 WHICH WAS ONE OF THE COMMONEST SLANG PHRASES INTENDED TO MEAN THAT THEY HAD NO FAULT TO FIND WITH THE ALASKA COMMERCIAL COMPANY AND THEIR STEAMER SAINT PAUL ALL WERE WELL CARED FOR AND SATISFIED AS WELL THEY MIGHT BE
3235-28452-0001 THEN CAME HARD RAIN AND WIND THAT FOR SEVERAL DAYS BLEW THE ICE BACK INTO THE BAY FIRST TO ONE SIDE AND THEN TO THE OTHER SO THAT THE STEAMERS WAITING TO COME IN COULD NOT DO SO FOR FEAR OF THE DRIFTING FLOES
3235-28452-0008 THEY CAME FROM THE EAST WEST NORTH AND SOUTH ALL SORRY TO KNOW OF HER ILLNESS AND BRINGING PRESENTS WITH THEM SOMETIMES IT WAS A LITTLE LIVE BIRD OR SQUIRREL A DELICIOUS SALMON TROUT
3235-28452-0022 THE LATTER NOW GROWN WILFUL BUT STILL SO BRIGHT AND PRETTY I WANTED TO TAKE BOTH WITH ME BUT NO I COULD NOT THE LITTLE GIRL'S WORK WAS NOT ENDED
3235-28452-0029 WHEN AUGUST CAME I SAILED AWAY THE DORA HAD ENTERED THE BAY IN THE MORNING AND FOUND MY TRUNK PACKED AND WAITING IT WAS THEN ONLY THE WORK OF A LITTLE TIME TO MAKE READY TO LEAVE
3240-131231-0002 I'D LIKE TO EMPHASIZE SOMETHING THAT I AM PERMITTED TO SEE BECAUSE I AM STILL PRIMITIVE OR INTELLIGENT OR IN A STATE OF MALADJUSTMENT
3240-131231-0016 BUT HERE ARE THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF A SCOOP IN THE EXCLUSIONIST IMAGINATION THERE IS NO REGARD FOR MUD DEBRIS FROM THE BOTTOM OF A POND FLOATING VEGETATION LOOSE THINGS FROM THE SHORES BUT A PRECISE PICKING OUT OF FROGS ONLY
3240-131231-0023 AFTER ONE OF THE GREATEST HURRICANES IN THE HISTORY OF IRELAND SOME FISH WERE FOUND AS FAR AS FIFTEEN YARDS FROM THE EDGE OF A LAKE HAVE ANOTHER THIS IS A GOOD ONE FOR THE EXCLUSIONISTS FALL OF FISH IN PARIS SAID THAT A NEIGHBORING POND HAD BEEN BLOWN DRY
3240-131231-0030 OF THE BRITISH MUSEUM BRISTLING WITH EXCLUSIONISM WRITES THAT SOME OF THESE FISHES WHICH HAD BEEN SENT TO HIM ALIVE WERE VERY YOUNG MINNOWS HE SAYS ON READING THE EVIDENCE IT SEEMS TO ME MOST PROBABLY ONLY A PRACTICAL JOKE
3240-131231-0043 LEIRUS GASTEROSTEUS IS THE STICKLEBACK ALTOGETHER I THINK WE HAVE NOT A SENSE OF TOTAL PERDITION
3240-131231-0057 DISREGARDING SERIAL SIGNIFICANCE OR MECHANICAL UNINTELLIGENT REPULSIVE REFLEX IS THAT THE FISHES OF INDIA DID NOT FALL FROM THE SKY THAT THEY WERE FOUND UPON THE GROUND AFTER TORRENTIAL RAINS BECAUSE STREAMS HAD OVERFLOWED AND HAD THEN RECEDED
3240-131231-0071 ACCORDING TO WITNESSES THE FALL UPON THIS SMALL AREA OCCUPIED TEN MINUTES I CANNOT THINK OF A CLEARER INDICATION OF A DIRECT FALL FROM A STATIONARY SOURCE AND
3240-131231-0078 AS TO DISCUSSION NOT A WORD OR SCIENCE AND ITS CONTINUITY WITH PRESBYTERIANISM DATA LIKE THIS ARE DAMNED AT BIRTH THE WEATHER REVIEW DOES SPRINKLE OR BAPTIZE OR ATTEMPT TO SAVE THIS INFANT
3240-131231-0085 OR ARGUES FOR A GREAT SPECIFIC DISTURBANCE OF WHICH THERE IS NO RECORD FOR THE MONTH OF MAY EIGHTEEN NINETY FOUR
3240-131232-0013 LITTLE OR BIG IF SUCH FALLS BE ATTRIBUTED TO WHIRLWINDS AND MORE LIKELY TO FALL FROM THE SUPER SARGASSO SEA IF THOUGH VERY TENTATIVELY AND PROVISIONALLY WE ACCEPT THE SUPER SARGASSO SEA
3240-131232-0020 BUT HAS ALWAYS SOUGHT POSITIVELY TO PROVE OR TO DISPROVE SOMETHING THAT WAS CONCEIVED OF OR SUSPECTED IN ADVANCE AS I SUSPECTED SAYS THIS CORRESPONDENT I FOUND THAT THE SNAILS WERE OF A FAMILIAR LAND SPECIES THAT THEY HAD BEEN UPON THE GROUND
3240-131232-0027 THESE DATA HAVE ANY MEANING OR LACK OF MEANING OR DEGREE OF DAMNATION YOU PLEASE BUT IN THE MATTER OF THE FALL THAT OCCURRED AT MEMPHIS TENNESSEE OCCUR SOME STRONG SIGNIFICANCES
3242-67153-0000 AND FINDS A FAIR MARGIN OF PROFIT IN SHOVING IT THERE'S A CHANCE FOR EVERYTHING YOU HAVE LEARNED FROM LATIN TO POETRY IN THE PACKING BUSINESS THOUGH WE DON'T USE MUCH POETRY HERE EXCEPT IN OUR STREET CAR ADS
3242-67153-0007 DRY SALT FOR THE NIGGERS DOWN SOUTH AND SUGAR CURED FOR THE WHITE FOLKS UP NORTH EVERYTHING ELSE WAS SAUSAGE OR THROWN AWAY BUT WHEN WE GET THROUGH WITH A HOG NOWADAYS HE'S SCATTERED THROUGH A HUNDRED DIFFERENT CANS AND PACKAGES AND HE'S ALL ACCOUNTED FOR WHAT WE USED TO THROW AWAY IS OUR PROFIT
3242-67153-0014 BESIDES I FELT THAT PERHAPS I HADN'T TREATED THE BOY JUST RIGHT AS I HAD DELIVERED QUITE A JAG OF THAT WHEAT TO HIS FATHER MYSELF HELLO JIM I CALLED DO YOU STILL WANT THAT JOB YES SIR HE ANSWERED QUICK AS LIGHTNING WELL
3242-67153-0028 I REMEMBER ONE PICTURE HE GOT OUT SHOWING SIXTEEN COWS STANDING BETWEEN SOMETHING THAT LOOKED LIKE A LETTER PRESS AND TELLING HOW EVERY POUND OR SO OF GRAHAM'S EXTRACT CONTAINED THE JUICE SQUEEZED FROM A HERD OF STEERS IF AN EXPLORER STARTED FOR THE NORTH POLE
3242-67153-0035 I SEE YOU'VE BEEN ELECTED PRESIDENT OF YOUR CLASS I'M GLAD THE BOYS AREN'T DOWN ON YOU BUT WHILE THE MOST POPULAR MAN IN HIS CLASS ISN'T ALWAYS A FAILURE IN BUSINESS BEING AS POPULAR AS THAT TAKES UP A HEAP OF TIME
3242-67168-0004 LAST YEAR WHEN I WAS BULLING THE MARKET THE LONGS ALL SAID THAT I WAS A KIND HEARTED OLD PHILANTHROPIST WHO WAS LAYING AWAKE NIGHTS SCHEMING TO GET THE FARMERS A TOP PRICE FOR THEIR HOGS
3242-67168-0018 WHO WAS A PLAYMATE OF MINE WHEN I WAS A BOY BUD WAS THE YOUNGEST OF THE WIDOW'S TROUBLES AND SHE WAS A WOMAN WHOSE TROUBLES SELDOM CAME SINGLY HAD FOURTEEN ALTOGETHER AND FOUR PAIR OF EM WERE TWINS
3242-67168-0025 AND WENT DOWN THE STREET TO THE CABIN OF LOUISIANA CLYTEMNESTRA AN OLD YELLOW WOMAN WHO WOULD GO INTO A TRANCE FOR FOUR BITS AND FIND A FORTUNE FOR YOU FOR A DOLLAR I RECKON SHE'D HAVE CALLED HERSELF A CLAIRVOYANT NOWADAYS BUT THEN SHE WAS JUST A VOODOO WOMAN
3242-67168-0032 FOR RIGHT THERE THE OLD LADY GOT UP WITH A MIGHTY SET EXPRESSION AROUND HER LIPS AND MARCHED OUT MUTTERING THAT IT WAS JUST AS SHE HAD THOUGHT ALL ALONG BUD WASN'T THERE AND WHEN THE NEIGHBORS DROPPED IN THAT AFTERNOON TO PLAN OUT A MEMORIAL SERVICE FOR HER LOST LAMB
3242-8112-0006 GOING OVER FOR VISITS TO MANTELISH'S GARDEN WITH MY FATHER IS ONE OF THE EARLIEST THINGS I REMEMBER I CAN IMAGINE HE'S A PROBLEM SHE SHIFTED HER GAZE CURIOUSLY FROM ONE TO THE OTHER OF THE TWO MEN WHAT ARE YOU PEOPLE DOING
3242-8112-0013 THEY'VE ALL BEEN TOLD WE'RE HEADING FOR A NEW GOLDEN AGE COURTESY OF THE PLASMOID SCIENCE PRACTICALLY EVERYBODY HAS BELIEVED IT NOW THERE'S CONSIDERABLE DOUBT
3242-8112-0020 I'M NOT ENOUGH OF A BIOLOGIST TO MAKE AN EDUCATED GUESS WHAT IT SEEMS TO BOIL DOWN TO IS THAT THEY MIGHT WHICH WOULD BE ENOUGH TO TEMPT A LOT OF PEOPLE TO GAMBLE VERY HIGH FOR A CHANCE TO GET CONTROL OF THE PLASMOID PROCESS
3242-8112-0034 BUT HIS TWO LAB GUARDS AND ONE OF THE RAIDERS WERE KILLED THE OTHERS GOT AWAY GESS FAYLE'S DEFECTION WAS A CERTAINTY BY THEN AND EVERYBODY WAS VERY NERVOUS THE FEDS GOT THERE FAST AND DEAD BRAINED THE RAIDER THEY LEARNED JUST TWO THINGS
3242-8112-0041 I THOUGHT TRIGGER SAID REFLECTIVELY YOU COULD UN BLOCK SOMEONE LIKE THAT YOU CAN SOMETIMES IF YOU'RE VERY GOOD AT IT AND IF YOU HAVE TIME ENOUGH WE COULDN'T AFFORD TO WAIT A YEAR THEY DIED BEFORE THEY COULD TELL US ANYTHING
3259-158083-0003 TO REDUCE THE NUMBER TO A MANAGEABLE SIZE BEFORE IMPRISONING THIS GROUP FAILING OF THAT THEY TRIED STILL ANOTHER WAY OUT THEY RESORTED TO IMPRISONMENT WITH TERRORISM
3259-158083-0016 BUT THEIR MINDS WERE TOO FULL OF THE POLITICAL ASPECT OF OUR OFFENSE TO CONCEAL IT THE TRUTH OF THE SITUATION IS THAT THE COURT HAS NOT BEEN GIVEN POWER TO MEET IT THE JUDGE LAMENTED IT IS VERY VERY PUZZLING I FIND YOU GUILTY OF THE OFFENSE CHARGED
3259-158083-0023 BUT ON THE GENERAL POPULACE OF WASHINGTON TO SEE THESE WOMEN FORCE WITH SUCH MAGNIFICENT DEFIANCE THE HAND OF A WAVERING ADMINISTRATION ON THE FOLLOWING MORNING
3259-158083-0030 MISSUS HERNDON WAS STANDING BEHIND A DESK WHEN WE WERE BROUGHT INTO THIS OFFICE AND THERE WERE FIVE OR SIX MEN ALSO IN THE ROOM
3259-158083-0044 A NEGRO TRUSTY WAS THERE I FELL BACK AGAIN INTO THE SAME STUPOR THE NEXT DAY THEY BROUGHT ME SOME TOAST AND A PLATE OF FOOD THE FIRST I HAD BEEN OFFERED IN OVER THIRTY SIX HOURS
3259-158083-0051 THE TERRIBLE ANXIETY AT HEADQUARTERS WAS NOT RELIEVED THE THIRD DAY BY A REPORT BROUGHT FROM THE WORKHOUSE BY ONE OF THE MARINES STATIONED AT QUANTICO STATION VIRGINIA WHO HAD BEEN SUMMONED TO THE WORKHOUSE ON THE NIGHT THE WOMEN ARRIVED
3259-158083-0058 ALL OF US WERE SEIZED BY MEN GUARDS AND DRAGGED TO CELLS IN MEN'S PART DOROTHY DAY WAS ROUGHLY USED BACK TWISTED MISSUS MARY A NOLAN SEVENTY THREE YEAR OLD PICKET FROM JACKSONVILLE FLORIDA FLUNG INTO CELL
3259-158083-0072 MISSUS LEWIS AND I SAID WE WOULD NOT BE FORCIBLY FED SAID HE WOULD CALL IN MEN GUARDS AND FORCE US TO SUBMIT WENT AWAY AND WE WERE NOT FED AT ALL THIS MORNING WE HEAR THEM OUTSIDE NOW CRACKING EGGS
3259-158083-0079 YOU GIRLS ARE ON YOUR NINTH DAY OF HUNGER STRIKE AND YOUR CONDITION IS CRITICAL IT IS A GREAT PITY THAT SUCH WOMEN SHOULD BE SUBJECTED TO THIS TREATMENT I HOPE THAT YOU WILL CARRY YOUR POINT
3259-158083-0086 SHE WROTE A COMPREHENSIVE AFFIDAVIT OF HER EXPERIENCE AFTER NARRATING THE EVENTS WHICH LED UP TO THE ATTACK SHE CONTINUES SUPERINTENDENT WHITTAKER THEN SHOUTED OUT IN A LOUD TONE OF VOICE
3259-158083-0100 I WAS EXHAUSTED BY WHAT I HAD SEEN AND BEEN THROUGH AND SPENT THE NIGHT IN ABSOLUTE TERROR OF FURTHER ATTACK AND OF WHAT MIGHT STILL BE IN STORE FOR US I THOUGHT OF THE YOUNG GIRLS WHO WERE WITH US AND FEARED FOR THEIR SAFETY THE GUARDS ACTED BRUTAL IN THE EXTREME
3259-158083-0107 ONE OF THE PARTY MISS FINDEISEN ASKED WHETHER THEY WOULD ATTACK US TO WHICH THE MATRON REPLIED THAT IS JUST WHAT THEY WOULD DO AND HURRIED US ALONG THE BAYING GREW LOUDER AND NEARER AT TIMES AND THEN MORE DISTANT AS THE DOGS RUSHED BACK AND FORTH
3259-158083-0114 THERE FOLLOWED A WEEK MORE MELODRAMATIC THAN THE MOST STIRRING MOVING PICTURE FILM ALTHOUGH THE WRIT HAD BEEN APPLIED FOR IN THE GREATEST SECRECY
328-129766-0002 AS YOU SHALL HEAR IN ITS TIME I CAME AWAY FOR ENGLAND IN THE MONTH OF AUGUST AFTER I HAD BEEN EIGHT YEARS IN THAT COUNTRY AND NOW A NEW SCENE OF MISFORTUNES ATTENDED ME WHICH PERHAPS FEW WOMEN HAVE GONE THROUGH THE LIFE OF
328-129766-0009 WHAT I BROUGHT WITH ME WAS INDEED CONSIDERABLE HAD IT COME SAFE AND BY THE HELP OF IT I MIGHT HAVE MARRIED AGAIN TOLERABLY WELL BUT AS IT WAS I WAS REDUCED TO BETWEEN TWO OR THREE HUNDRED POUNDS IN THE WHOLE AND THIS WITHOUT ANY HOPE OF RECRUIT
328-129766-0016 BUT HAD THE DISCOURAGEMENT TO FIND THIS WAY OF LIVING SUNK ME EXCEEDINGLY AND THAT AS I HAD NO SETTLED INCOME SO SPENDING UPON THE MAIN STOCK WAS BUT A CERTAIN KIND OF BLEEDING TO DEATH AND THIS GAVE ME MANY SAD REFLECTIONS IN THE INTERVAL OF MY OTHER THOUGHTS
328-129766-0030 SO I DID NOT FAIL TO LET MY NEW FRIEND KNOW THAT I EXPECTED A SUPPLY FROM THENCE AND SO INDEED I DID AND AS THE SHIPS WENT FROM BRISTOL TO YORK RIVER IN VIRGINIA AND BACK AGAIN GENERALLY IN LESS TIME FROM LONDON
328-129766-0037 AND HE HAD SUCH AN OPINION OF MY VIRTUE THAT AS HE OFTEN PROFESSED HE BELIEVED IF HE SHOULD OFFER ANYTHING ELSE I SHOULD REJECT HIM WITH CONTEMPT HE SOON UNDERSTOOD FROM ME THAT I WAS A WIDOW THAT I HAD ARRIVED AT BRISTOL FROM VIRGINIA BY THE LAST SHIPS
328-129766-0044 I TOLD HER I HAD NOT GIVEN HIM THE LEAST OCCASION TO THINK I WANTED IT
328-129766-0058 AND SMILING SAID HE HOPED I WOULD NOT WANT MONEY AND NOT TELL HIM OF IT AND THAT I HAD PROMISED HIM OTHERWISE I TOLD HIM I HAD BEEN VERY MUCH DISSATISFIED AT MY LANDLADY'S TALKING SO PUBLICLY THE DAY BEFORE OF WHAT SHE HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH
328-129766-0065 WHERE I HAD ABOUT SIX GUINEAS MORE AND SOME SILVER AND THREW IT ALL DOWN UPON THE BED AND TOLD HIM THERE WAS ALL MY WEALTH HONESTLY TO A SHILLING HE LOOKED A LITTLE AT IT BUT DID NOT TELL IT
328-129766-0072 AND THAT HE THOUGHT I HAD MERITED IT FROM HIM BY GIVING HIM MY COMPANY SO ENTIRELY AS I HAD DONE AFTER THIS HE MADE ME TAKE A MAID AND KEEP HOUSE
328-129766-0086 AND WHEN HE GREW QUITE WELL HE MADE ME A PRESENT OF FIFTY GUINEAS FOR MY CARE AND AS HE CALLED IT FOR HAZARDING MY LIFE TO SAVE HIS AND NOW HE MADE DEEP PROTESTATIONS OF A SINCERE INVIOLABLE AFFECTION FOR ME
328-129766-0093 HE DECENTLY WENT OUT OF THE ROOM TILL I WAS IN BED AND THEN WENT TO BED IN THE BED ON HIS OWN SIDE OF THE ROOM BUT LAY THERE TALKING TO ME A GREAT WHILE AT LAST REPEATING HIS USUAL SAYING THAT HE COULD LIE NAKED IN THE BED WITH ME AND NOT OFFER ME THE LEAST INJURY
332-128985-0001 AND HIS OWN WAS UNKNOWN AND THE BRAZILIAN BECAUSE HE WAS BORN IN BRAZIL THOUGH OF DUTCH PARENTS UNLIKE MOST OF HIS FELLOW PRACTITIONERS HE DID NOT GRADUALLY BECOME A PIRATE FROM HIS EARLY YOUTH
332-128985-0014 WOULD PROBABLY HAVE FELT THE EDGE OF THAT CUTLASS DESCENDING RAPIDLY THROUGH HIS PHYSICAL ORGANISM HE WAS A MAN WHO INSISTED UPON BEING OBEYED AND IF ANY ONE OF HIS CREW BEHAVED IMPROPERLY OR WAS EVEN FOUND IDLE
332-128985-0028 AND FIND OUT WHETHER OR NOT THERE WERE ANY SPANISH VESSELS IN THE BAY WHICH WERE WELL LADEN AND WHICH WERE LIKELY SOON TO COME OUT SO WITH A SMALL BOAT FILLED WITH SOME OF HIS TRUSTY MEN HE ROWED QUIETLY INTO THE PORT TO SEE WHAT HE COULD DISCOVER
332-128985-0042 AND THE FIRST THING HE DID WAS TO BRING SOME WRITING MATERIALS TO ROC WHO THEREUPON BEGAN THE COMPOSITION OF A LETTER
332-128985-0049 THE NEXT DAY WET AND BEDRAGGLED FROM MAKING HIS WAY THROUGH THE WEEDS AND MUD OF THE COAST HE PRESENTED HIMSELF AT THE FORTRESS WITH HIS LETTER AND WHEN HE WAS ALLOWED TO TAKE IT TO THE GOVERNOR NO ONE SUSPECTED THAT HE WAS A PERSON EMPLOYED ABOUT THE PLACE
332-128985-0056 WAS THE NATURAL INCLINATION OF THE GOVERNOR NOW ROC AND HIS MEN WERE TREATED WELL AND HAVING BEEN BROUGHT BEFORE THE GOVERNOR WERE TOLD THAT IN CONSEQUENCE OF THEIR HAVING COMMITTED NO OVERT ACT OF DISORDER THEY WOULD BE SET AT LIBERTY AND SHIPPED TO ENGLAND
332-128985-0070 AND WITH A LARGE COMPANY OF BUCCANEERS HE ACTUALLY SET OUT TO TAKE A TOWN HAVING LOST EVERYTHING HE POSSESSED AND HAVING PASSED SUCH A LONG TIME WITHOUT ANY EMPLOYMENT MORE PROFITABLE THAN THAT OF SHOOTING FISH WITH A BOW AND ARROWS
332-128985-0077 IN A MARINE COMBAT IT IS SELDOM THAT A PARTY OF BOARDERS IS ATTACKED IN THE REAR BY THE ENEMY ALTHOUGH ON LAND SUCH METHODS OF WARFARE MAY ALWAYS BE EXPECTED
332-128985-0084 BUT THIS DOWNFALL OF A HERO SIMPLY SHOWS THAT ESQUEMELING ALTHOUGH HE WAS A MEMBER OF THE PIRATICAL BODY AND WAS PROUD TO CONSIDER HIMSELF A BUCCANEER DID NOT UNDERSTAND THE TRUE NATURE OF A PIRATE UNDER THE BRUTALITY
3374-298025-0009 A SUBTLE FIRE FLOWED THROUGH MY VEINS
3374-298025-0016 SO THE CALM BROAD SILVERY RIVER WINDS ALONG IN GREAT BENDS AND SWEEPS UNTIL IT AND THE LOVER'S FANTASY CRADLED UPON IT LIKE THE SWAN PASS AWAY INTO THE DISTANCE AND LOSE THEMSELVES IN THE IMMEASURABLE
3374-298025-0023 A PERIOD WHICH TAKEN AS A WHOLE OR IN PARTS I CAN NEVER LOOK BACK UPON WITHOUT A GREAT DEAL OF INWARD AMUSEMENT A LITTLE MELANCHOLY AND CONSIDERABLE SELF SATISFACTION
3374-298026-0004 EACH IDEA DEVELOPS A COUNTLESS PROGENY
3374-298026-0011 YOU KNOW NOTHING THE WOMANLINESS OF YOUR SOUL ASIDE FROM MINOR PECULIARITIES CONSISTS IN ITS REGARDING LIFE AND LOVE AS THE SAME THING FOR YOU ALL FEELING IS INFINITE AND ETERNAL
3374-298026-0018 AS THAT LAST GLASS OF CHAMPAGNE WE DRANK TOGETHER WHEN I SAID AND SO LET US DRINK OUT THE REST OF OUR LIVES
3374-298026-0032 BUT THEN MY LONGING GREW AGAIN IRRESISTIBLE UNTIL ON ITS WINGS I SANK BACK INTO YOUR ARMS SUPPOSE WORDS OR A HUMAN BEING TO CREATE A MISUNDERSTANDING BETWEEN US
3374-298026-0039 HOW CAN A MAN WISH TO WRITE ANYTHING WHICH IT IS SCARCELY PERMISSIBLE TO TALK ABOUT WHICH OUGHT ONLY TO BE FELT
3374-298026-0046 SINCE SHE TOO IS A LADY WHOM I LOVE MOST TENDERLY
3374-298032-0013 I HELD MY HEAD UP AND CRIED ALOUD
3374-298032-0020 AS WHEN A PERSON SUDDENLY FINDS HIMSELF ALONE IN THE MIDST OF IMMEASURABLE MOUNTAINS OF ICE EVERYTHING ABOUT ME AND IN ME WAS COLD AND STRANGE AND EVEN MY TEARS FROZE
3374-298032-0027 I FELT THAT ITS MYSTERIOUS LIFE WAS RICHER AND DEEPER THAN THE VULGAR HEALTH OF THE DREAMING SLEEP WALKERS ALL AROUND ME AND WITH THE SICKLINESS WHICH WAS NOT AT ALL UNPLEASANT
3374-298032-0041 AND ONLY IN THAT WAY DOES A HUMAN BEING BECOME ONE AND A COMPLETE ENTITY THAT IS BY REGARDING AND POETICALLY CONCEIVING HIMSELF AS THE CENTRE OF EVERYTHING AND THE SPIRIT OF THE WORLD
3436-172162-0005 SO UPON THE MORN THEY TOOK THEIR HORSES WITH THE QUEEN AND RODE A MAYING IN WOODS AND MEADOWS AS IT PLEASED THEM IN GREAT JOY AND DELIGHT NOW THERE WAS A KNIGHT
3436-172162-0012 THEN THEY LASHED TOGETHER WITH SWORDS TILL SEVERAL WERE SMITTEN TO THE EARTH SO WHEN THE QUEEN SAW HER KNIGHTS THUS DOLEFULLY OPPRESSED AND NEEDS MUST BE SLAIN AT THE LAST THEN FOR PITY AND SORROW SHE CRIED SIR MALEAGANS
3436-172162-0025 THEN SIR LAUNCELOT WENT AWHILE AND HE WAS EXCEEDINGLY CUMBERED BY HIS ARMOR HIS SHIELD AND HIS SPEAR AND ALL THAT BELONGED TO HIM THEN BY CHANCE THERE CAME BY HIM A CART THAT CAME THITHER TO FETCH WOOD
3436-172162-0032 NEITHER WOULD THE DAMSELS PREPARE A BED FOR HIM HE SEIZED THE FIRST HE FOUND UNOCCUPIED AND WAS LEFT UNDISTURBED NEXT MORNING HE SAW FROM THE TURRETS OF THE CASTLE A TRAIN ACCOMPANYING A LADY WHOM HE IMAGINED TO BE THE QUEEN
3436-172162-0039 AFTER AN EASY VICTORY ONLY DOOMED HIM TO BE CARTED IN HIS TURN AT NIGHT HE WAS RECEIVED AT ANOTHER CASTLE WITH GREAT APPARENT HOSPITALITY BUT FOUND HIMSELF IN THE MORNING IN A DUNGEON AND LOADED WITH CHAINS
3436-172171-0000 WHERE HE WAS BROUGHT UP IN TOTAL IGNORANCE OF ARMS AND CHIVALRY HE WAS ALLOWED NO WEAPON
3436-172171-0007 AND PERCEVAL WENT TO THE PLACE WHERE THEY KEPT THE HORSES THAT CARRIED FIREWOOD AND PROVISIONS FOR THE CASTLE AND HE TOOK A BONY PIEBALD HORSE WHICH SEEMED TO HIM THE STRONGEST OF THEM AND HE PRESSED A PACK INTO THE FORM OF A SADDLE
3436-172171-0014 AND HE GAVE THE MAIDEN HIS OWN RING IN EXCHANGE FOR HERS THEN HE MOUNTED HIS HORSE AND RODE AWAY PERCEVAL JOURNEYED ON TILL HE ARRIVED AT ARTHUR'S COURT AND IT SO HAPPENED
3436-172171-0028 AND TO TAKE FROM THEE THE GOBLET AND THY HORSE AND ARMOR FOR MYSELF SILENCE SAID THE KNIGHT GO BACK TO THE COURT AND TELL ARTHUR EITHER TO COME HIMSELF
3436-172171-0035 AND URGED ON HIS HORSE WITH A STICK THEN OWAIN WOULD HAVE HAD HIM RETURN TO THE COURT TO RECEIVE THE PRAISE THAT WAS HIS DUE BUT PERCEVAL SAID I WILL NOT COME TO THE COURT TILL I HAVE ENCOUNTERED THE TALL MAN THAT IS THERE
3436-172171-0042 FOOTNOTE THE WORD MEANS BOTH FISHER AND SINNER THOU SHALT REMAIN WITH ME A SPACE IN ORDER TO LEARN THE MANNERS AND CUSTOMS OF DIFFERENT COUNTRIES AND COURTESY AND NOBLE BEARING AND THIS DO THOU REMEMBER
3436-172171-0056 OR HE IS THINKING OF THE LADY WHOM BEST HE LOVES IF IT SEEM WELL TO THEE LORD I WILL GO AND SEE IF THIS KNIGHT HAS CHANGED FROM HIS THOUGHT AND IF HE HAS I WILL ASK HIM COURTEOUSLY TO COME AND VISIT THEE
3436-172171-0063 I AM RIGHT GLAD TO MEET THEE SAID PERCEVAL FOR I HAVE EVERYWHERE HEARD OF THY PROWESS AND UPRIGHTNESS AND I SOLICIT THY FELLOWSHIP THOU SHALT HAVE IT BY MY FAITH AND GRANT ME THINE SAID HE
3440-171006-0004 I WILL NOT LET THEE GO EXCEPT THOU BLESS ME AND THUS IT WAS WITH ELSIE SHE KNEW NOW THAT HER FATHER WAS NOT A CHRISTIAN THAT HE HAD NO REAL LOVE FOR JESUS NONE OF THE TRUE FEAR OF GOD BEFORE HIS EYES
3440-171006-0018 AND I BELIEVE HIM I DID GO TO HIM AND HE DID NOT CAST ME OUT BUT FORGAVE MY SINS AND TAUGHT ME TO LOVE HIM AND DESIRE TO SERVE HIM ALL MY LIFE THIS CONVERSATION BETWEEN THE GENTLEMAN AND THE LITTLE GIRL HAD DRAWN THE ATTENTION OF ALL PRESENT
3440-171006-0025 SHE ASKED RAISING HER HEAD TO GIVE HIM A SMILE OF JOYFUL WELCOME I DID NOT KNOW YOU WERE THERE AH I HAVE BEEN WATCHING YOU FOR SEVERAL MINUTES HE SAID ALWAYS PORING OVER THE SAME BOOK ELSIE DO YOU NEVER TIRE OF IT NO INDEED PAPA
3440-171009-0002 QUITE DIFFERENT FROM SOME OF THE LITTLE GUESTS WHO HAD BEEN UP FAR BEYOND THEIR USUAL HOURS THE NIGHT BEFORE AND HAVING JUST LEFT THEIR BEDS HAD COME DOWN PALE AND LANGUID IN LOOKS AND IN SOME INSTANCES SHOWING PEEVISH AND FRETFUL TEMPERS
3440-171009-0016 SUPPLIED HARRY CARRINGTON AN OLDER BROTHER OF LUCY'S WITH A BOOK AND TWO YOUNGER BOYS WITH DISSECTED MAPS TO ARRANGE THE FOUR GIRLS SAT DOWN IN A CIRCLE ON THE CARPET AND BEGAN THEIR GAME FOR A FEW MOMENTS ALL WENT ON SMOOTHLY
3440-171009-0023 MISTER DINSMORE PASSED OUT OF ONE DOOR WHILE ELSIE LEFT BY THE OTHER THE THREE LITTLE GIRLS LOOKED INQUIRINGLY INTO EACH OTHER'S FACES WHAT IS THE MATTER WHAT HAS ELSIE DONE ASKED CARRY IN A WHISPER I DON'T KNOW
3440-171009-0030 I AM ALWAYS DISPLEASED WHEN YOU DISOBEY ME ELSIE HE REPLIED VERY GRAVELY LAYING HIS OTHER HAND ON HER HEAD I AM VERY SORRY I WAS NAUGHTY PAPA SHE SAID HUMBLY AND CASTING DOWN HER EYES
3440-171009-0044 VERY SWEET LITTLE GIRL I AM SURE AND I SHALL LOVE YOU DEARLY SHE SAID KISSING HER SEVERAL TIMES AH I WOULD GIVE ANYTHING IF I HAD SUCH A CLEAR FAIR COMPLEXION AND SUCH ROSY CHEEKS THAT MAKES YOU BLUSH WELL I LIKE TO SEE IT
3440-171009-0051 FOR SOME PERSONS TALK IN A VERY THOUGHTLESS WAY AND WITHOUT PERHAPS INTENDING TO BE EXACTLY UNTRUTHFUL SAY A GREAT DEAL THAT THEY REALLY DO NOT MEAN AND I SHOULD BE SORRY INDEED TO SEE MY LITTLE GIRL SO SPOILED BY ALL THIS SILLY FLATTERY
3440-171009-0058 NO LUCY I MUST OBEY MY FATHER ELSIE ANSWERED IN A VERY PLEASANT BUT NO LESS DECIDED TONE SOME ONE CAUGHT HER ROUND THE WAIST AND LIFTED HER UP OH PAPA SHE EXCLAIMED I DID NOT KNOW YOU WERE THERE
3440-171009-0072 STILL YOU HAVE NOT ANSWERED MY QUESTION HE SAID WITH A SMILE AS HE SAT DOWN AND DREW HER TO HIS SIDE ADDING IN A PLAYFUL TONE COME I AM NOT GOING TO PUT UP WITH ANY EVASION TELL ME TRULY IF YOU WOULD HAVE PREFERRED SOMETHING ELSE
3440-171009-0079 FOR THOUGH I TOO AM FOND OF SWEET THINGS I WILL NOT EAT THEM WHILE I REFUSE THEM TO YOU DO PAPA SHE URGED IT WOULD GIVE ME PLEASURE TO SEE YOU ENJOYING IT NO DARLING I WILL WAIT UNTIL TO MORROW TOO
3486-166424-0003 THEN LEAPED TO THE VERY BRIM OF THE BOWL A LARK HAD RISEN FROM THE ROOF OF ONE OF THE SHATTERED HEAPS AND HAD FLOWN CAROLING UP INTO THE SHADOWY SKY A FLOCK OF THE LITTLE WILLOW WARBLERS FLUNG THEMSELVES ACROSS THE VALLEY SCOLDING AND GOSSIPING
3486-166424-0016 HE REACHED OUT TOUCHED ME YOU'RE RIGHT WALTER HE GRINNED IT DOES SEEM LIKE CARRYING COALS TO NEWCASTLE
3486-166424-0030 WHAT WAS IT AT WHICH THEY WERE GLARING OVER OUR HEADS AND WHY HAD THE RIFLE FIRE OF RUTH AND DRAKE CEASED SO ABRUPTLY SIMULTANEOUSLY WE TURNED WITHIN THE BLACK BACKGROUND OF THE FISSURE STOOD A SHAPE AN APPARITION
3486-166424-0044 BEFORE THE CRY HAD CEASED THERE POURED WITH INCREDIBLE SWIFTNESS OUT OF THE CREVICE SCORE UPON SCORE OF THE METAL THINGS THE FISSURES VOMITED THEM
3486-166424-0051 FLEXING THEMSELVES IN GROTESQUE IMITATION OF A BOXER
3486-166424-0058 WITH AMUSEMENT BEFORE THEY COULD COVER A HUNDRED YARDS IT HAD DISINTEGRATED I HEARD THE LITTLE WAILING SOUNDS THEN BEHIND THE FLEEING MEN CLOSE BEHIND THEM ROSE THE ANGLED PILLAR INTO PLACE SPRANG THE FLEXING ARMS AND AGAIN IT TOOK ITS TOLL OF THEM
3486-166424-0072 I THOUGHT THAT SHIN JE WAS ABOUT TO SLAY US HE WHISPERED FEAR BLINDED ME HIS HEAD DROPPED HIS BODY QUIVERED LAY STILL WE AROSE LOOKED ABOUT US DAZEDLY
3486-166446-0003 NOW IN THE PAINFUL SURGES OF AWAKENING REALIZATION OF FULL HUMAN UNDERSTANDING OF THAT INHUMAN ANNIHILATION I TURNED TO THEM FOR STRENGTH FAINTLY I WONDERED AGAIN AT RUTH'S SCANTINESS OF GARB HER MORE THAN HALF NUDITY
3486-166446-0010 THEY TORTURED HIM THEY GAVE HIM AGONY UNTIL HE RETURNED AND THEY PROMISED HIM OTHER AGONIES THAT WOULD MAKE HIM PRAY LONG FOR DEATH AND ME ME SHE RAISED LITTLE CLENCHED HANDS
3486-166446-0024 AGAIN HE THREW HIMSELF FORWARD RECOILED AS THOUGH SWEPT BACK BY AN INVISIBLE ARM FELL AGAINST US AND WAS CLASPED AND HELD BY VENTNOR AND AS HE STRUGGLED THE THING WE RODE HALTED
3486-166446-0031 THE THING QUIETED IT BEGAN ITS STEADY EFFORTLESS STRIDING THROUGH THE CROWDING TREES BUT NOW WITH NONE OF THAT SPEED WITH WHICH IT HAD COME SPURRED FORWARD BY NORHALA'S AWAKENED HATE VENTNOR STIRRED
3486-166446-0038 AS THOUGH THEY HEARD AND UNDERSTOOD I DO NOT FORGET HE SAID AT LEAST NOT ALL DO I FORGET OF WHAT I SAW DURING THAT TIME WHEN I SEEMED AN ATOM OUTSIDE SPACE
3526-175658-0008 THE PORTRESS AFTER HAVING ANSWERED IN THE AFFIRMATIVE MY QUESTION AS TO WHETHER HER MISTRESS WAS AT HOME OPENED THE FOLDING DOORS OF A ROOM TO THE LEFT AND HAVING USHERED ME IN CLOSED THEM BEHIND ME I FOUND MYSELF IN A SALON
3526-175658-0015 YES SHE SAID SHE OFTEN THOUGHT SO AND ADDED
3526-175658-0022 PRETTY HER FEATURES WERE NOT NOR VERY SOFT NOR VERY REGULAR BUT NEITHER WERE THEY IN ANY DEGREE PLAIN AND I ALREADY SAW CAUSE TO DEEM THEM EXPRESSIVE WHAT WAS THEIR PREDOMINANT CAST
3526-176651-0000 AND HER DEEP EYES FIXED ON THE SMOKE IN THE VALLEY BELOW HER BREATH WAS STILL COMING FAST BETWEEN HER PARTED LIPS THERE WERE TINY DROPS ALONG THE ROOTS OF HER SHINING HAIR FOR THE CLIMB HAD BEEN STEEP
3526-176651-0007 BEYOND THE BLUE SMOKE DRIFTING IN THE VALLEY THOSE LIMITLESS BLUE WAVES MUST RUN UNDER THE SUN ON AND ON TO THE END OF THE WORLD HER DEAD SISTER HAD GONE INTO THAT FAR SILENCE
3526-176651-0014 WITH A THUMPING HEART SHE PUSHED SLOWLY FORWARD THROUGH THE BRUSH UNTIL HER FACE FOX LIKE WITH CUNNING AND SCREENED BY A BLUEBERRY BUSH HUNG JUST OVER THE EDGE OF THE CLIFF AND THERE SHE LAY
3526-176653-0005 AND AS HE HAD LEFT HIS HORSE BELOW AND HIS GUN SHE WAITED FOR HIM TO COME BACK WHICH HE DID BY AND BY DRIPPING AND SOAKED TO HIS KNEES THEN SHE SAW HIM UNTIE THE QUEER GUN ON HIS SADDLE PULL IT OUT OF A CASE AND
3526-176653-0012 WHERE NO ANSWER WHAT'S YOUR NAME LITTLE GIRL AND STILL SHE STARED
3526-176653-0019 DRAWLED A VOICE FROM THE BUSHES AND IT HAD A TONE THAT MADE THE FISHERMAN WHIRL SUDDENLY A GIANT MOUNTAINEER STOOD ON THE BANK ABOVE HIM WITH A WINCHESTER IN THE HOLLOW OF HIS ARM HOW ARE YOU
3526-176653-0033 AND IT WAS A QUICK AND CUNNING RUSE HE OWED HER SOMETHING FOR THAT WHY DID SHE TRY TO PROTECT HIM WONDERFUL EYES TOO THE LITTLE THING HAD DEEP AND DARK AND HOW THE FLAME DID DART FROM THEM WHEN SHE GOT ANGRY HE SMILED REMEMBERING
3526-176653-0040 SAID THE OLD MAN CHUCKLING BUT THAR'S A SIGHT OF EM DOWN THAR BELOW MY OLD MILL QUIETLY THE OLD WOMAN HIT THE HORSE WITH A STRIPPED BRANCH OF ELM AND THE OLD GRAY WITH A SWITCH OF HIS TAIL STARTED
3526-176653-0047 STILL THERE WAS NO SOUND OF OX OR WAGON AND THE VOICE SOUNDED LIKE A CHILD'S SO HE WENT ON AT A WALK IN THE THICK SAND AND WHEN HE TURNED THE BUSHES HE PULLED UP AGAIN WITH A LOW LAUGH
3607-135982-0005 AND A NEATLY GROOMED YOUNG MAN NAMED DOYLE SEGOUIN WAS IN GOOD HUMOUR BECAUSE HE HAD UNEXPECTEDLY RECEIVED SOME ORDERS IN ADVANCE HE WAS ABOUT TO START A MOTOR ESTABLISHMENT IN PARIS
3607-135982-0019 BUT JIMMY WHO IN SPITE OF TEMPORARY ERRORS WAS AT HEART THE INHERITOR OF SOLID INSTINCTS KNEW WELL WITH WHAT DIFFICULTY IT HAD BEEN GOT TOGETHER THIS KNOWLEDGE HAD PREVIOUSLY KEPT HIS BILLS WITHIN THE LIMITS OF REASONABLE RECKLESSNESS
3607-135982-0033 WHEN SEGOUIN SHEPHERDED HIS PARTY INTO POLITICS HERE WAS CONGENIAL GROUND FOR ALL JIMMY UNDER GENEROUS INFLUENCES FELT THE BURIED ZEAL OF HIS FATHER WAKE TO LIFE WITHIN HIM HE AROUSED THE TORPID ROUTH AT LAST
3607-135982-0040 THEY PROCEEDED TOWARDS IT WITH LINKED ARMS SINGING CADET ROUSSEL IN CHORUS STAMPING THEIR FEET AT EVERY HO HO HOHE VRAIMENT THEY GOT INTO A ROWBOAT AT THE SLIP AND MADE OUT FOR THE AMERICAN'S YACHT THERE WAS TO BE SUPPER MUSIC CARDS
3607-135982-0047 THEY WERE DEVILS OF FELLOWS BUT HE WISHED THEY WOULD STOP IT WAS GETTING LATE SOMEONE GAVE THE TOAST OF THE YACHT THE BELLE OF NEWPORT AND THEN SOMEONE PROPOSED ONE GREAT GAME FOR A FINISH THE PIANO HAD STOPPED VILLONA MUST HAVE GONE UP ON DECK
3607-29116-0009 I HAVE NO CONCEALMENTS FROM YOU BUT I HAVE ONE PRINCIPLE IN MY PUBLIC LIFE WHICH I SHOULD LIKE YOU TO KEEP IN MIND IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN MY GUIDE I NEVER PUSH A PRIVATE INTEREST IF IT IS NOT JUSTIFIED AND ENNOBLED BY SOME LARGER PUBLIC GOOD
3607-29116-0016 OH I SAW SENATOR BALLOON HE WILL HELP US I SUPPOSE BALLOON IS A WHOLE HEARTED FELLOW I CAN'T HELP LOVING THAT MAN FOR ALL HIS DROLLERY AND WAGGISHNESS HE PUTS ON AN AIR OF LEVITY SOMETIMES BUT THERE AINT A MAN IN THE SENATE KNOWS THE SCRIPTURES AS HE DOES
3607-29116-0023 ERASING FIGURING AND TALKING TO HERSELF FREE I WONDER WHAT DILWORTHY DOES THINK OF ME ANYWAY ONE TWO EIGHT SEVENTEEN
3607-29116-0037 WHAT WE WANT ABROAD IS GOOD EXAMPLES OF THE NATIONAL CHARACTER JOHN JAY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN WERE WELL ENOUGH IN THEIR DAY BUT THE NATION HAS MADE PROGRESS SINCE THEN BALLOON IS A MAN WE KNOW AND CAN DEPEND ON TO BE TRUE TO HIMSELF
3607-29116-0044 I QUITE AGREE WITH YOU COLONEL SELLERS WELL HESITATED THE COLONEL I AM AFRAID SOME OF THEM DO BUY THEIR SEATS YES I AM AFRAID THEY DO BUT AS SENATOR DILWORTHY HIMSELF SAID TO ME IT IS SINFUL IT IS VERY WRONG IT IS SHAMEFUL
3664-11714-0005 HAD FLED FROM HIS FATHER'S HOUSE AND HAD TAKEN THE VOWS IN THE CLOISTER OF DOMINICAN MONKS AT FLORENCE THERE WHERE HE WAS APPOINTED BY HIS SUPERIORS TO GIVE LESSONS IN PHILOSOPHY THE YOUNG NOVICE HAD FROM THE FIRST TO BATTLE AGAINST THE DEFECTS OF A VOICE THAT WAS BOTH HARSH AND WEAK
3664-11714-0019 HE REPLIED WITH A GROAN WHICH PROVED THE MONK'S MEMORY TO BE ONLY TOO TRUE THEN AT LAST WHEN HE HAD FINISHED LORENZO ASKED IN A DOUBTFUL TONE THEN DO YOU BELIEVE MY FATHER THAT GOD WILL FORGIVE ME EVERYTHING BOTH MY SINS AND MY CRIMES
3664-11714-0026 AND DIVERTED THE CITIZENS FROM THE DOUBLE PATH OF MILITARY AND CIVIL LIFE WHEREIN BEFORE THEY WERE ENERVATED BY YOUR LUXURIES THEY HAD DISPLAYED THE VIRTUES OF THE ANCIENTS AND THEREFORE WHEN THE DAY SHALL DAWN WHICH IS NOT FAR DISTANT CONTINUED THE MONK
3664-178355-0001 WHO WAS THEN CHIEF OF SCOUTS AT FORT WALLACE KANSAS COMSTOCK HAD THE REPUTATION FOR A LONG TIME OF BEING A MOST SUCCESSFUL BUFFALO HUNTER AND THE OFFICERS IN PARTICULAR WHO HAD SEEN HIM KILL BUFFALOES WERE VERY DESIROUS OF BACKING HIM IN A MATCH AGAINST ME
3664-178355-0015 AND I REMEMBER ONE FAIR LADY WHO ENDEAVORED TO PREVAIL UPON ME NOT TO ATTEMPT IT THAT'S NOTHING AT ALL SAID I I HAVE DONE IT MANY A TIME AND OLD BRIGHAM KNOWS AS WELL AS I WHAT I AM DOING AND SOMETIMES A GREAT DEAL BETTER SO LEAVING MY SADDLE AND BRIDLE WITH THE WAGONS
3664-178355-0022 IN THIS CONNECTION IT WILL NOT BE OUT OF PLACE TO STATE THAT DURING THE TIME I WAS HUNTING FOR THE KANSAS PACIFIC I ALWAYS BROUGHT INTO CAMP THE BEST BUFFALO HEADS AND TURNED THEM OVER TO THE COMPANY WHO FOUND A VERY GOOD USE FOR THEM THEY HAD THEM MOUNTED IN THE BEST POSSIBLE MANNER
3664-178355-0029 A PURSE OF TWO HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS WAS MADE UP TO BE GIVEN TO THE HORSE THAT COULD FIRST REACH WYANDOTTE FOUR MILES DISTANT THE ARRANGEMENT WAS CARRIED OUT AND BRIGHAM WAS ENTERED AS ONE OF THE CONTESTANTS FOR THE PURSE
3664-178366-0006 COLONEL WILSON EDITOR OF THE JOURNAL MISTER SAM JOHNSON GENERAL RUCKER AND OTHERS BY ALL OF WHOM I WAS MOST CORDIALLY RECEIVED AND WELL ENTERTAINED I WAS INTRODUCED TO QUITE A NUMBER OF THE BEST PEOPLE OF THE CITY AND WAS INVITED TO SEVERAL SWELL DINNERS
3664-178366-0013 I FINALLY COMPROMISED THE MATTER BY AGREEING TO DIVIDE MY TIME BETWEEN THE UNION CLUB THE BREVOORT HOUSE AND NED BUNTLINE'S QUARTERS THE NEXT FEW DAYS I SPENT IN VIEWING THE SIGHTS OF NEW YORK EVERYTHING BEING NEW AND STARTLING
3664-178366-0020 BOTH MISTER JEROME AND MISTER HECKSHER TOLD ME THAT I MUST NOT DISAPPOINT MISTER BELMONT FOR HIS DINNERS WERE SPLENDID AFFAIRS I MADE A NOTE OF THE DATE AND AT THE APPOINTED TIME I WAS PROMPTLY AT MISTER BELMONT'S MANSION WHERE I SPENT A VERY ENJOYABLE EVENING
3664-178366-0034 THIS HE WILLINGLY DID AND THEN INFORMED ME THAT MY SERVICES WOULD SOON BE REQUIRED AT FORT MC PHERSON AS THERE WAS TO BE AN EXPEDITION SENT OUT FROM THAT POINT AT WESTCHESTER PENNSYLVANIA I HAD SOME RELATIVES LIVING WHOM I HAD NEVER SEEN
3699-175950-0003 YOU MUST MEAN YOUR UNCLE'S REPLIED MY GREAT GRANDMOTHER MY GREAT GRANDFATHER WAS CONVINCED HE UNTWISTED THE PAPER AND SIGNED THE ARTICLE
3699-175950-0010 THAT IT MUST BE ONE OF THE GREATEST PROBLEMS IN CIVIL LIFE WHERE THE SAME NUMBER OF LONG AND JOLLY NOSES FOLLOWING ONE ANOTHER IN A DIRECT LINE
3699-175950-0023 WHILST I AM POURING FORTH THE WARMEST SENTIMENT OF LOVE FOR THEE AND VENERATION FOR THE EXCELLENCY OF THY CHARACTER THAT EVER VIRTUE AND NATURE KINDLED IN A NEPHEW'S BOSOM
3699-19401-0011 THAT WIDOW WADMAN AN PLEASE YOUR WORSHIP CANNOT HOLD IT OUT TEN DAYS AND WHENCE CRIED SLOP JEERINGLY HAST THOU ALL THIS KNOWLEDGE OF WOMAN FRIEND
3699-19401-0025 THERE WAS NOTHING WHICH SHOULD PUT IT OFF BEYOND THE NEXT MORNING SO ACCORDINGLY IT WAS RESOLV'D UPON FOR ELEVEN O'CLOCK
3699-19402-0005 A THIN BLUE CHILL PELLUCID CHRYSTAL WITH ALL ITS HUMOURS SO AT REST THE LEAST MOTE OR SPECK OF DESIRE MIGHT HAVE BEEN SEEN AT THE BOTTOM OF IT HAD IT EXISTED
3699-19402-0012 THOUGH THE CORPORAL HAD BEEN AS GOOD AS HIS WORD IN PUTTING MY UNCLE TOBY'S GREAT RAMALLIE WIG INTO PIPES YET THE TIME WAS TOO SHORT TO PRODUCE ANY GREAT EFFECTS FROM IT IT HAD LAIN MANY YEARS SQUEEZED UP IN THE CORNER OF HIS OLD CAMPAIGN TRUNK
3699-19402-0026 YOUR HONOUR REPLIED THE CORPORAL KNOWS OF TOM'S MISFORTUNES BUT THIS AFFAIR HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THEM ANY FURTHER THAN THIS
3699-47246-0002 BESIDES THINK OF ALL THE VIRTUOUS DECLAMATION ALL THE PENETRATING OBSERVATION WHICH HAD BEEN BUILT UP ENTIRELY ON THE FUNDAMENTAL POSITION THAT THE COUNTESS WAS A VERY OBJECTIONABLE PERSON INDEED
3699-47246-0009 HAD WON A PARTNERSHIP IN A SILK MANUFACTORY AND THEREBY A MODERATE FORTUNE THAT ENABLED HIM TO RETIRE AS YOU SEE TO STUDY POLITICS THE WEATHER AND THE ART OF CONVERSATION AT HIS LEISURE
3699-47246-0023 THE SEVEREST LADIES IN MILBY WOULD HAVE BEEN PERFECTLY AWARE THAT THESE CHARACTERISTICS WOULD HAVE CREATED NO WIDE DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE COUNTESS CZERLASKI AND THEMSELVES AND SINCE IT WAS CLEAR THERE WAS A WIDE DISTINCTION
3699-47246-0030 FOR YOU HAVE ALREADY PERCEIVED THAT THERE WAS ONE BEING TO WHOM THE COUNTESS WAS ABSORBINGLY DEVOTED AND TO WHOSE DESIRES SHE MADE EVERYTHING ELSE SUBSERVIENT NAMELY CAROLINE CZERLASKI NEE BRIDMAIN
3723-171115-0004 AND MARCHED TOWARDS JERICHO WITH FIVE COHORTS WHICH MACHAERUS SENT WITH HIM
3723-171115-0018 SOON BEAT THOSE THAT OPPOSED HIM AND AFTER HE HAD BEATEN THEM HE ALWAYS TURNED HIS FORCE AGAINST THOSE THAT STOOD TO IT STILL AND PURSUED THEM ALL SO THAT A GREAT SLAUGHTER WAS MADE WHILE SOME WERE FORCED BACK INTO THAT VILLAGE WHENCE THEY CAME OUT
3723-171115-0025 AND THEY HAD LAIN THERE FOR SOME TIME IN GREAT TERROR AND IN PRIVACY AND WHEN THEY SAW THE KING THEY TREMBLED FOR FEAR AND RAN BY HIM IN A FLIGHT ALTHOUGH HE WAS NAKED AND ENDEAVORED TO GET OFF INTO THE PUBLIC ROAD
3723-171115-0032 WHICH WERE ELEVEN REGIMENTS OF FOOTMEN AND SIX THOUSAND HORSEMEN BESIDES THE SYRIAN AUXILIARIES WHICH WERE NO SMALL PART OF THE ARMY THEY PITCHED THEIR CAMP NEAR TO THE NORTH WALL HEROD'S DEPENDENCE WAS UPON THE DECREE OF THE SENATE
3723-171115-0046 HE ALSO FORBADE AT THE SAME TIME THE SPOILING OF THE CITY ASKING SOSIUS IN THE MOST EARNEST MANNER WHETHER THE ROMANS BY THUS EMPTYING THE CITY OF MONEY AND MEN HAD A MIND TO LEAVE HIM KING OF A DESERT
3723-171115-0053 NOW CLEOPATRA HAD PUT TO DEATH ALL HER KINDRED TILL NO ONE NEAR HER IN BLOOD REMAINED ALIVE AND AFTER THAT SHE FELL A SLAYING THOSE NO WAY RELATED TO HER SO SHE CALUMNIATED THE PRINCIPAL MEN AMONG THE SYRIANS TO ANTONY
3723-171631-0002 THAN FROM THE HEART OF MAN IT IS ALWAYS IN ACTION AND MOTION STILL BUSY STILL PRETENDING TO DO ALL TO FURNISH ALL THE POWERS AND FACULTIES WITH ALL THAT THEY HAVE
3723-171631-0016 AND THE MALIGNITY OF ILL MEN IS ALSO DIRECTED UPON THE GREATEST AND THE BEST AND NOT ONLY GREATNESS BUT GOODNESS LOSES THE VIGOUR OF BEING AN ANTIDOTE OR CORDIAL AGAINST IT
3723-171631-0023 ALL THAT THOU ASKEST OF ME IS MY HEART MY SON GIVE ME THY HEART
3723-171631-0030 AND WOULDST THOU HAVE MY HEART O GOD OF ALL LIGHT I KNOW THOU KNOWEST ALL AND IT IS THOU
3723-171631-0044 THIS SICK THIS DISEASEFUL WORLD AS LONG AS I REMAIN IN THIS LEPROUS HOUSE THIS FLESH OF MINE THIS HEART THOUGH THUS PREPARED FOR THEE PREPARED BY THEE
3723-171631-0051 BUT THY DWELLING IN HIS HEART ENABLED HIM TO KEEP THAT COVENANT THY SON HIMSELF HAD A SADNESS IN HIS SOUL TO DEATH AND HE HAD A RELUCTATION A DEPRECATION OF DEATH IN THE APPROACHES THEREOF
3723-171631-0058 OR BID IT MEET THEE THIS DAY IN PARADISE I ASK NOT NOT IN A WISH NOT IN A THOUGHT INFIRMITY OF NATURE CURIOSITY OF MIND ARE TEMPTATIONS THAT OFFER
374-180298-0010 SHE WOULD WRITE TO ME IN THE MORNING THAT SHE WOULD DINE WITH ME NOT AT HOME BUT AT SOME RESTAURANT IN PARIS OR IN THE COUNTRY I WOULD CALL FOR HER AND WE WOULD DINE AND GO ON TO THE THEATRE OFTEN HAVING SUPPER AS WELL
374-180298-0017 VERY MUCH IN NEED OF MONEY AND NOT POSSESSING THE FORTUNE NECESSARY FOR SUPPORTING THE LIFE THEY LEAD THEY GAMBLE THEN AND WITH THIS RESULT OR ELSE THEY GAIN AND THEN THOSE WHO LOSE SERVE TO PAY FOR THEIR HORSES AND MISTRESSES
374-180298-0024 FOR THE MOST OF THEM GAMBLING WAS A NECESSITY FOR ME IT WAS A REMEDY FREE OF MARGUERITE I SHOULD HAVE BEEN FREE OF GAMBLING THUS IN THE MIDST OF ALL THAT I PRESERVED A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF SELF POSSESSION
374-180298-0038 MARGUERITE WAS AWAKENED BY THE SUNLIGHT POURING INTO HER ROOM AND JUMPING OUT OF BED ASKED ME IF I WOULD TAKE HER INTO THE COUNTRY FOR THE WHOLE DAY
374-180298-0045 AS PRUDENCE HAD TOLD US IT WAS THE REAL COUNTRY AND I MUST ADD IT WAS A REAL LUNCH IT IS NOT ONLY OUT OF GRATITUDE FOR THE HAPPINESS I OWE IT
374-180298-0052 THE SUN SHONE UPON MY MISTRESS AS IT MIGHT HAVE SHONE UPON THE PUREST BRIDE WE WALKED TOGETHER IN THOSE CHARMING SPOTS WHICH SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN MADE ON PURPOSE TO RECALL THE VERSES OF LAMARTINE OR TO SING THE MELODIES OF SCUDO
374-180299-0000 CHAPTER SEVENTEEN NEXT DAY MARGUERITE SENT ME AWAY VERY EARLY SAYING THAT THE DUKE WAS COMING AT AN EARLY HOUR AND PROMISING TO WRITE TO ME THE MOMENT HE WENT AND TO MAKE AN APPOINTMENT FOR THE EVENING
374-180299-0007 HE HAS ASKED ME HOW I LOVING PARIS AS I DO COULD MAKE UP MY MIND TO BURY MYSELF IN THE COUNTRY I TOLD HIM THAT I WAS ILL AND THAT I WANTED REST HE SEEMED TO HAVE SOME DIFFICULTY IN BELIEVING ME
374-180299-0014 HOWEVER MARGUERITE'S PLEASURE IN SEEING HER FRIENDS WAS A LITTLE MODERATED WHEN SHE SAW THE EXPENSE WHICH THAT PLEASURE ENTAILED AND ESPECIALLY THE NECESSITY SHE WAS SOMETIMES IN OF ASKING ME FOR MONEY THE DUKE
374-180299-0028 AND I WILL NOT CONCEAL THE FACT THAT I AM LIVING WITH HIM IT IS FOLLY NO DOUBT BUT I LOVE HIM WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE ME DO AND THEN NOW THAT HE HAS GOT ACCUSTOMED TO BE ALWAYS WITH ME
374-180299-0035 ANY ONE WHO HAD SEEN US LEAVING THE HOUSE TO GO ON THE RIVER IN THE CHARMING LITTLE BOAT WHICH I HAD BOUGHT WOULD NEVER HAVE BELIEVED THAT THE WOMAN DRESSED IN WHITE WEARING A STRAW HAT
374-180299-0042 THE DUKE WROTE TO HER TWO OR THREE TIMES SHE RECOGNISED THE WRITING AND GAVE ME THE LETTERS WITHOUT READING THEM SOMETIMES THE TERMS OF THESE LETTERS BROUGHT TEARS TO MY EYES HE HAD IMAGINED THAT BY CLOSING HIS PURSE TO MARGUERITE
3807-4923-0009 LESLY AND ANOTHER BURST INTO A LAUGH AT THIS WILD PROPOSITION BUT REX WHO HAD WEIGHED HIS CHANCES WELL BEFOREHAND FELT THE FORCE OF THE PILOT'S SPEECH AND ANSWERED SERIOUSLY IT'S NO USE TALKING HE SAID SHAKING HIS STILL HANDSOME HEAD
3807-4923-0016 IN THE BOLDNESS OF THE SPEECH HOWEVER LAY ITS SAFEGUARD REX WHOSE POLITENESS WAS MERE BRAVADO WAS STUNG TO THE QUICK BY THE REFLECTION UPON HIS COURAGE AND THE BITTER ACCENT WITH WHICH THE CHILD HAD PRONOUNCED THE WORD PRISONER
3807-4923-0023 IT CRIED AND WAS THEN SEEMINGLY CHOKED IN ITS OWNER'S THROAT THE VOICE WAS THE PROPERTY OF MISTER BATES STANDING NEAR THE SIDE HE HAD OBSERVED REX AND FAIR BRING UP A GREAT PIG OF IRON ERST USED AS PART OF THE BALLAST OF THE BRIG
3807-4923-0037 AND A LOADED MUSKET ACROSS HIS KNEES THE WHITE OBJECT WHICH HAD BEEN SEEN BY THE MEN IN THE WHALE BOAT WAS A LARGE WHITE SHAWL WHICH WRAPPED MISSUS VICKERS AND SYLVIA
3807-4923-0044 AND CLAD IN DAZZLING MAIL OR AT THE VERY LEAST AS A MUSCULAR HERO WHO WOULD SETTLE AFFAIRS OUT OF HAND BY SHEER PERSONAL PROWESS IF SHE HAD ENTERTAINED ANY SUCH NOTION THE REALITY MUST HAVE STRUCK COLDLY UPON HER SENSES
3807-4923-0051 WHICH IS IT TO BE WE'LL GO WITH YOU SAYS THE MAN WHO HAD PULLED THE STROKE IN THE WHALE BOAT SPITTING INTO THE WATER WITH AVERTED FACE UPON WHICH UTTERANCE THE CONVICTS BURST INTO JOYOUS OATHS AND THE PAIR WERE RECEIVED WITH MUCH HAND SHAKING
3807-4955-0006 SAW A WILD WASTE OF RAGING SEAS SCOOPED INTO ABYSMAL TROUGHS IN WHICH THE BULK OF A LEVIATHAN MIGHT WALLOW AT THE BOTTOM OF ONE OF THESE VALLEYS OF WATER LAY THE MUTINEERS BOAT LOOKING WITH ITS OUTSPREAD OARS LIKE SOME SIX LEGGED INSECT
3807-4955-0013 AS THE MEN SET THE BOAT'S HEAD TO THE WELCOME LINE OF LIGHTS THAT MARKED THE NECK A BLACK SPOT BALANCED UPON A BLACK LINE WAS SWEPT UNDER THEIR STERN AND CARRIED OUT TO SEA AS IT PASSED THEM THIS BLACK SPOT EMITTED A CRY
3807-4955-0020 IN THIS CONDITION PLUS A SWOON FROM EXHAUSTION HE WAS DESCRIED BY THE HELMSMAN OF THE PRETTY MARY A FEW MILES FROM CAPE SURVILLE AT DAYLIGHT NEXT MORNING
3807-4955-0034 THE MADAM'S I'LL BE BOUND AY SHE'S A KNOWING ONE AND THE SINISTER LAUGHTER OF THE PAIR FLOATED ACROSS THE VIOLET WATER GO EASY MAN SAID BLUNT AS THEY NEARED THE SHORE THEY'RE ALL AWAKE AT EAGLEHAWK AND IF THOSE CURSED DOGS GIVE TONGUE
3830-12529-0001 AND SUCH FUEL FOR THE CAMP FIRE BROKEN LIMBS WITH JUST ENOUGH PITCH TO MAKE A CHEERFUL BLAZE AND YET BODY ENOUGH TO LAST WELL
3830-12530-0002 UPON THE EASTERN SLOPE OF THE SHORES OF THIS BAY LAY THE TWO TOWNS PORT STEILACOOM AND STEILACOOM CITY BOTH ESTABLISHED IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY ONE A FAR LARGER TRADE CENTERED HERE THAN AT ANY OTHER POINT ON PUGET SOUND
3830-12530-0015 A PERPENDICULAR BLUFF ROSE FROM THE HIGHWATER MARK LEAVING NO PLACE FOR CAMP FIRE OR BED
3830-12530-0029 PASS TRAIL INTO WASHINGTON THEY LOCATED IN A BODY OVER NEARLY THE WHOLE VALLEY AND BEFORE THE YEAR WAS ENDED HAD MADE A ROUGH WAGON ROAD OUT TO THE PRAIRIES
3830-12530-0043 ON THEIR FISHING EXCURSIONS IN CANOES MANNED BY THIRTY MEN OR MORE AFTER SPENDING TWO OR THREE DAYS EXPLORING THE COUNTRY WE TURNED BACK TO THE BAY WHERE LAY THE SEVEN SHIPS WE HAD SEEN NEAR STEILACOOM WE REMEMBERED THE TIMBER CAMPS
3830-12531-0004 WHILE I WAS TO GO HOME FOR THE WIFE AND BABY TO REMOVE THEM TO OUR NEW HOME I DID NOT PARTICULARLY MIND THE CAMPING BUT I DID NOT FANCY THE IDEA OF LYING OUT SO NEAR HOME IF BY EXTRA EXERTION I COULD REACH THE CABIN BEFORE NIGHT
3830-12531-0011 MUCH OF THE CONVERSATION NATURALLY CENTERED ON THE QUESTION OF OUR MOVING TO A NEW HOME WHY AT OLYMPIA EGGS WERE A DOLLAR A DOZEN I SAW THEM SELLING AT THAT THE BUTTER YOU HAVE THERE WOULD BRING YOU A DOLLAR A POUND AS FAST AS YOU COULD WEIGH IT OUT
3830-12531-0025 A VERY LITTLE FOOD AND NO MONEY THE MONEY HAD ALL BEEN EXPENDED ON THE CANOE PASSAGE SHOULD WE PACK THE OXEN AND WALK
3830-12535-0000 CHAPTER SEVENTEEN FINDING MY PEOPLE ON LEAVING MY NEWLY FOUND FRIENDS I FACED A DISCOURAGING PROSPECT THE START FOR THE HIGH ARID TABLE LANDS BORDERING THE YAKIMA VALLEY CUT ME LOOSE FROM ALL COMMUNICATION
3830-12535-0007 FINDING THAT THE ROAD COULD BE FOLLOWED THOUGH BUT DIMLY SEEN I KEPT ON THE TRAIL UNTIL A LATE HOUR WHEN I UNSADDLED AND HOBBLED THE PONY THE SADDLE BLANKET WAS BROUGHT INTO USE AND I WAS SOON OFF IN DREAMLAND FORGETTING ALL ABOUT THE DUST THE TRAIL OR THE MORROW
3830-12535-0021 DUSK CAME ON AND STILL NO SIGNS THEN I SPIED SOME CATTLE GRAZING ON THE UPLAND AND SOON CAME UPON THE CAMP IN A RAVINE THAT HAD SHUT IT FROM VIEW REJOICING AND OUTBURSTS OF GRIEF FOLLOWED I INQUIRED FOR MY MOTHER THE FIRST THING
3830-12535-0028 I HAVE OFTEN THOUGHT THAT SOME ONE OUGHT TO WRITE A JUST TRIBUTE TO THEIR VALOR AND PATIENCE A BOOK OF THEIR HEROIC DEEDS ONE DAY WE ENCOUNTERED A NEWLY FALLEN TREE COCKED UP ON ITS OWN UPTURNED ROOTS FOUR FEET FROM THE GROUND GO AROUND IT WE COULD NOT
3857-180923-0001 BUT TO DEAL WITH THE REGIMENT ON THE PERSONAL SIDE IS HARDLY POSSIBLE WITHIN THE LIMITS OF SUCH A SKETCH AS THIS THOUGH IT IS A MATTER THAT CANNOT BE ENTIRELY PASSED BY
3857-180923-0015 AND AFTER THE WAR WAS FOR SOME YEARS RECTOR OF SAINT JOHN'S CHURCH IN SALISBURY HE WAS LATER CONNECTED WITH A CHURCH COLLEGE IN MISSOURI WHERE HE DIED IN EIGHTEEN NINETY EIGHT
3857-180923-0022 MEMORABLE AMONG THESE MEETINGS WAS THE ONE HELD ON OCTOBER TWENTY FIRST EIGHTEEN NINETY SIX THE OCCASION BEING THE DEDICATION OF THE REGIMENT'S MONUMENT IN THE NATIONAL CEMETERY AT ARLINGTON
3857-180923-0029 AND EVERY TOWN AMONG US HAS KNOWN SOME OF THEM EVER SINCE AMONG ITS LEADING FIGURES WHILE SOME IN QUARTERS FAR DISTANT HAVE ALSO ATTAINED TO HONORS AND RESPONSIBILITIES AS THE RECORDS SHOW
3857-182315-0013 THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO ARE DISAPPOINTED IN US ARE THOSE WHO STILL BELIEVE THAT CLAY STORY OR WHO UNCONSCIOUSLY STILL LET IT COLOR THEIR THINKING THERE CERTAINLY SEEMS TO BE A POWER AT WORK IN THE WORLD
3857-182315-0020 FAMILIAR WITH THE WAYS OF EVOLUTION ELSEWHERE IN THE UNIVERSE WE NATURALLY SHOULD HAVE WONDERED WHAT COURSE IT WOULD TAKE ON THIS EARTH EVEN IN THIS OUT OF THE WAY CORNER OF THE COSMOS WE MIGHT HAVE REFLECTED AND ON THIS TINY STAR
3857-182315-0027 AND IN THESE ORDERLY INSECTS THERE ARE OBVIOUSLY A CAPACITY FOR LABOR AND CO OPERATIVE LABOR AT THAT WHICH COULD CARRY THEM FAR WE ALL KNOW THAT THEY HAVE A MARKED GENIUS GREAT GIFTS OF THEIR OWN
3857-182315-0041 THEY CAN'T BEAR TO STOP THEY KEEP RIGHT ON WORKING THIS MEANS THAT ANTS DO NOT CONTEMPLATE THEY HEED NOTHING OUTSIDE OF THEIR OWN LITTLE ROUNDS IT IS ALMOST AS THOUGH THEIR FONDNESS FOR LABOR HAD CLOSED FAST THEIR MINDS
3857-182317-0002 ONE MUST GRANT THEY ARE VASSALS NOT RULERS THEY ARE TOO PARASITIC THE ONE WILLING SERVANT CLASS OF THE WORLD AND WE HAVE BETRAYED THEM BY MAKING UNDER SIMIANS OF THEM
3857-182317-0009 AND NOT NARROW NOT SELF ABSORBED FOR THEY SEEM INTERESTED IN EVERYTHING WHAT WAS IT THEN THAT PUT THEM OUT OF THE RACE COULD IT HAVE BEEN A QUITE NATURAL BELIEF THAT THEY HAD ALREADY WON AND WHEN THEY SAW THAT THEY HADN'T
3857-182317-0023 HAS EVER HAD THAT MUCH BRAINS IT MAKES YOU WONDER WHAT OTHER OBVIOUS LESSONS MAY STILL BE UNLEARNED IT IS NOT NECESSARILY STUPID HOWEVER TO FAIL TO USE TOOLS TO USE TOOLS INVOLVES USING REASON
3857-182317-0030 WE ATTAIN NO POWER OVER NATURE TILL WE LEARN NATURAL LAWS AND OUR LORDSHIP DEPENDS ON THE ADROITNESS WITH WHICH WE LEARN AND CONFORM ADROITNESS HOWEVER IS MERELY AN ABILITY TO WIN
3879-173592-0003 A HUMBLER ADVENTURER WAS PIERRE GAMBIE A ROBUST AND DARING YOUTH
3879-173592-0016 WITH HIDEOUS GRIMACES HOWLINGS AND CONTORTIONS HE WROUGHT HIMSELF INTO A PROPHETIC FRENZY AND PROCLAIMED TO THE ASTOUNDED WARRIORS
3879-173592-0023 SOME WERE DIGGING ROOTS IN THE FOREST OR GATHERING A KIND OF SORREL UPON THE MEADOWS IF THEY HAD HAD ANY SKILL IN HUNTING AND FISHING THE RIVER AND THE WOODS WOULD HAVE SUPPLIED THEIR NEEDS BUT IN THIS POINT AS IN OTHERS
3879-173592-0030 LEST THEY SHOULD PAY THE PENALTY OF THEIR EXTORTION THEY WOULD NOT ENTER THE FORT
3879-174923-0000 THAT HE SHOULD BE ELECTED AND NOW HE DID THINK IT PROBABLE THAT HE SHOULD GET THE SEAT ON A PETITION A SCRUTINY USED TO BE A VERY EXPENSIVE BUSINESS BUT UNDER THE EXISTING LAW MADE AS THE SCRUTINY WOULD BE IN THE BOROUGH ITSELF
3879-174923-0007 SO YOU'RE AT THE OLD GAME MISTER FINN SAID HIS LANDLORD YES AT THE OLD GAME I SUPPOSE IT'S THE SAME WITH YOU NOW MISTER BUNCE HAD BEEN A VERY VIOLENT POLITICIAN
3879-174923-0014 JUST AS THE THEATRES ARE MISTER FINN OR THE GIN SHOPS THEN I KNOW THERE'S A DEAL MORE TO BE DONE BEFORE HONEST MEN CAN COME BY THEIR OWN YOU'RE RIGHT ENOUGH MISTER FINN YOU ARE AS FAR AS CHURCHES GO AND YOU WAS RIGHT TOO WHEN YOU CUT AND RUN OFF THE TREASURY BENCH
3879-174923-0028 WHILE HIS YOUNG WIFE WAS LIVING HE HAD KEPT HIS SIGHS DOWN SO THAT SHE SHOULD NOT HEAR THEM BUT HE HAD BEEN FORCED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT HIS NEW LIFE HAD BEEN VAPID AND FLAVOURLESS NOW HE HAD BEEN TEMPTED BACK AGAIN TO THE OLD HAUNTS
3879-174923-0035 WHEN PHINEAS EXPLAINED THAT HE HAD THROWN UP HIS PLACE AND THEN THEY SETTLED DOWN ON THE QUESTION OF THE DAY AND SO SAID MISSUS LOW YOU'VE BEGUN TO ATTACK THE CHURCH IT MUST BE REMEMBERED THAT AT THIS MOMENT MISTER DAUBENY
3879-174923-0042 IT WOULD BE MY BUSINESS TO DO SO BUT I AM NOT A PRIEST MISTER LOW GAVE HIS OLD FRIEND A BOTTLE OF HIS BEST WINE AND IN ALL FRIENDLY OBSERVANCES TREATED HIM WITH DUE AFFECTION BUT NEITHER DID HE NOR DID HIS WIFE
3879-174923-0056 HE DECLARES THAT MISTER BROWBOROUGH IS ALMOST DISPOSED NOT TO FIGHT THE BATTLE THOUGH A MAN MORE DISPOSED TO FIGHT NEVER BRIBED AN ELECTOR BUT BARRINGTON SEEMS TO THINK THAT YOU MANAGED AS WELL AS YOU DID BY GETTING OUTSIDE THE TRACES AS HE CALLS IT
3879-174923-0063 ALL OUR GOOD THINGS WENT FROM US AT A BLOW I AND MY POOR FATHER BECAME AS IT WERE OUTCASTS BUT OSWALD SUDDENLY RETRICKED HIS BEAMS AND IS FLAMING IN THE FOREHEAD OF THE MORNING SKY HE I BELIEVE
3879-174923-0070 I HAVE TOLD PAPA THAT I SHOULD ASK YOU AND HE WOULD BE DELIGHTED
39-121914-0011 WHICH HAD SOON FOLLOWED ISABELLA'S MARRIAGE ON THEIR BEING LEFT TO EACH OTHER WAS YET A DEARER TENDERER RECOLLECTION SHE HAD BEEN A FRIEND AND COMPANION SUCH AS FEW POSSESSED INTELLIGENT
39-121914-0018 THROUGH AT HARTFIELD BEFORE CHRISTMAS BROUGHT THE NEXT VISIT FROM ISABELLA AND HER HUSBAND
39-121914-0025 YOU KNOW WE HAVE SETTLED ALL THAT ALREADY
39-121914-0039 IT IS IMPOSSIBLE THAT EMMA SHOULD NOT MISS SUCH A COMPANION SAID MISTER KNIGHTLEY WE SHOULD NOT LIKE HER SO WELL AS WE DO SIR IF WE COULD SUPPOSE IT BUT SHE KNOWS HOW MUCH THE MARRIAGE IS TO MISS TAYLOR'S ADVANTAGE
39-121914-0046 AND BORROWED TWO UMBRELLAS FOR US FROM FARMER MITCHELL'S I MADE UP MY MIND ON THE SUBJECT I PLANNED THE MATCH FROM THAT HOUR AND WHEN SUCH SUCCESS HAS BLESSED ME IN THIS INSTANCE DEAR PAPA
39-121914-0053 THAT IT WOULD BE A SHAME TO HAVE HIM SINGLE ANY LONGER AND I THOUGHT WHEN HE WAS JOINING THEIR HANDS TO DAY HE LOOKED SO VERY MUCH AS IF HE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THE SAME KIND OFFICE DONE FOR HIM I THINK VERY WELL OF MISTER ELTON
39-121915-0010 AND HE HAD ONLY HIS OWN COMFORT TO SEEK AND HIS OWN SITUATION TO IMPROVE AS HE COULD A COMPLETE CHANGE OF LIFE BECAME DESIRABLE HE QUITTED THE MILITIA AND ENGAGED IN TRADE
39-121915-0017 ON COMING OF AGE IT WAS MOST UNLIKELY THEREFORE THAT HE SHOULD EVER WANT HIS FATHER'S ASSISTANCE HIS FATHER HAD NO APPREHENSION OF IT THE AUNT WAS A CAPRICIOUS WOMAN AND GOVERNED HER HUSBAND ENTIRELY
39-121915-0024 MISSUS WESTON HAD OF COURSE FORMED A VERY FAVOURABLE IDEA OF THE YOUNG MAN AND SUCH A PLEASING ATTENTION WAS AN IRRESISTIBLE PROOF OF HIS GREAT GOOD SENSE
39-121916-0004 AND MISSUS GODDARD THREE LADIES ALMOST ALWAYS AT THE SERVICE OF AN INVITATION FROM HARTFIELD AND WHO WERE FETCHED AND CARRIED HOME SO OFTEN THAT MISTER WOODHOUSE THOUGHT IT NO HARDSHIP FOR EITHER JAMES OR THE HORSES
39-121916-0011 HUNG ROUND WITH FANCY WORK WHENEVER SHE COULD AND WIN OR LOSE A FEW SIXPENCES BY HIS FIRESIDE THESE WERE THE LADIES WHOM EMMA FOUND HERSELF VERY FREQUENTLY ABLE TO COLLECT
39-121916-0018 NOT UNWILLING TO TALK AND YET SO FAR FROM PUSHING SHEWING SO PROPER AND BECOMING A DEFERENCE SEEMING SO PLEASANTLY GRATEFUL FOR BEING ADMITTED TO HARTFIELD
39-121916-0031 AND ON THE PRESENT EVENING HAD PARTICULAR PLEASURE IN SENDING THEM AWAY HAPPY
3947-13260-0013 WILL NOT REALLY LESSEN VERY MUCH THE AWFUL CONDITION AT THE RECTANGLE AS LONG AS THE SALOON IS LEGALLY ESTABLISHED THERE I THINK THAT IS TRUE OF ANY CHRISTIAN WORK NOW BEING CARRIED ON IN ANY GREAT CITY
3947-13260-0027 I SUPPOSE HE IS WRITING ANOTHER BOOK IS HE GOING TO PUT YOU INTO THIS ONE RACHEL YOU KNOW I ALWAYS SUSPECTED JASPER CHASE OF DOING THAT VERY THING IN HIS FIRST STORY VIRGINIA
3947-13260-0034 VIRGINIA CAME TO HER AND PUT HER ARM ABOUT HER TENDERLY WHEN RACHEL HAD LEFT THE HOUSE VIRGINIA SAT IN THE HALL THINKING OVER THE CONFIDENCE HER FRIEND HAD JUST SHOWN HER THERE WAS SOMETHING STILL TO BE TOLD VIRGINIA FELT SURE FROM RACHEL'S MANNER
3947-13260-0041 VIRGINIA SPOKE THE NAME OF A YOUNG SOCIETY LEADER GOING ABOUT TO THE CLUBS DOING YOUR WORK ROLLIN THE TWO WALKED ON IN SILENCE FOR THE LENGTH OF THE HALL COMING BACK TO RACHEL BEGAN VIRGINIA
3947-13262-0004 WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN DOING ALL SUMMER I HAVE NOT SEEN MUCH OF YOU RACHEL SUDDENLY ASKED AND THEN HER FACE WARMED WITH ITS QUICK FLUSH OF TROPICAL COLOR AS IF SHE MIGHT HAVE IMPLIED TOO MUCH INTEREST IN ROLLIN OR TOO MUCH REGRET AT NOT SEEING HIM OFTENER
3947-13262-0011 WHAT PURPOSE I COULD NOW HAVE IN MY LIFE TO REDEEM IT TO SATISFY MY THOUGHT OF CHRISTIAN DISCIPLESHIP AND THE MORE I THOUGHT OF IT THE MORE I WAS DRIVEN TO A PLACE WHERE I KNEW I MUST TAKE UP THE CROSS
3947-13262-0018 HER INTEREST IN HIS PLAN WAS LARGER THAN MERE CURIOSITY ROLLIN PAGE WAS SO DIFFERENT NOW FROM THE FASHIONABLE YOUNG MAN WHO HAD ASKED HER TO BE HIS WIFE THAT SHE COULD NOT HELP THINKING OF HIM AND TALKING WITH HIM AS IF HE WERE AN ENTIRELY NEW ACQUAINTANCE
3947-13262-0032 I AM BEGINNING TO KNOW WHAT IT MEANS TO BE LOVED BY A NOBLE MAN I SHALL LOVE ROLLIN PAGE AFTER ALL WHAT AM I SAYING RACHEL WINSLOW HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN SHE ROSE AND WALKED BACK AND FORTH SHE WAS DEEPLY MOVED
3947-13262-0039 BUT A MILLION DOLLARS IN THE HANDS OF A PERSON WHO TRULY WANTS TO DO WITH IT AS JESUS WOULD
3947-13262-0046 WAS NOT THE LIVING SOURCE OF NEARLY ALL THE HUMAN MISERY THEY SOUGHT TO RELIEVE UNTOUCHED AS LONG AS THE SALOONS DID THEIR DEADLY BUT LEGITIMATE WORK
3982-178459-0008 SHE PAUSED AND HE CAME IN NOT LIFTING HIS EYES TO HERS ALWAYS WHEN HE CROSSED THAT THRESHOLD HE HAD COME WITH HIS HEAD UP AND HIS WISTFUL GAZE SEEKING HERS
3982-178459-0015 BOTH OF HER HANDS LEAPED TO HER CHEEKS SHE GREW RED AND THEN WHITE SHE ROSE SLOWLY AND MOVED BACKWARD FROM HIM STARING AT HIM AT FIRST INCREDULOUSLY THEN WITH AN INTENSE PERPLEXITY MORE AND MORE LUMINOUS IN HER WIDE EYES
3982-178459-0022 YOU COULD SHE LOOKED AT HIM AND SLOWLY SHOOK HER HEAD BIBBS DO YOU HER VOICE WAS AS UNSTEADY AS HIS LITTLE MORE THAN A WHISPER DO YOU THINK I'M
3982-178459-0036 AND TO DAY I HEARD THAT THAT YOU
3982-178459-0043 YOU THOUGHT THAT I WAS FOND OF YOU YOU KNEW I CARED FOR YOU BUT YOU DIDN'T THINK I MIGHT BE IN LOVE WITH YOU BUT YOU THOUGHT THAT I MIGHT MARRY YOU WITHOUT BEING IN LOVE WITH YOU
3982-178459-0050 AND I WONDER MYSELF WHY WHEN A FAMILY LOSES ITS MONEY PEOPLE ALWAYS SAY THE DAUGHTERS OUGHT TO GO AND BE STENOGRAPHERS IT'S CURIOUS
3982-178459-0064 AND WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT SHE DID SHE SET HER HANDS UPON HIS BREAST PUSHING HIM BACK FROM HER A LITTLE I CAN'T I CAN'T DON'T YOU SEE MARY NO NO AND YOU MUST GO NOW BIBBS I CAN'T BEAR ANY MORE PLEASE
3982-182255-0004 AND THEN LEANING FORWARDS IN HIS CHAIR AND LOOKING CAREFULLY ABOUT THE CORRIDORS OF THE CLUB HE SPOKE BEHIND HIS HAND AND SAID AND THE MAYOR'S THE BIGGEST GRAFTER OF THE LOT AND WHAT'S MORE HE ADDED
3982-182255-0011 AND THEN SHOOK THEIR HEADS AND TOOK LONG DRINKS OF WHISKEY AND SODA THEN NATURALLY SPEAKING OF THE ROTTENNESS OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAD LED THEM TO TALK OF THE ROTTENNESS OF THE STATE LEGISLATURE
3982-182255-0025 SOMETIMES ONE SAW A PICTURE IN THE PAPER AND WONDERED FOR A MOMENT WHO THE PERSON WAS BUT ON LOOKING MORE CLOSELY AND NOTICING WHAT WAS WRITTEN UNDER IT ONE SAID OH I SEE AN ALDERMAN AND TURNED TO SOMETHING ELSE WHOSE FUNERAL IS THAT

3983-5331-0048 AND HE TOOK HIS COURSE TO TELL HER THE TRUTH SHE WAS TO BORROW THE WORDS BARBARA HAD USED TO HER BROTHER WITH REGARD TO HIM TRUE AS STEEL CONFIDE TO MISS CARLYLE A SECRET AND SHE WAS TRUSTWORTHY AND IMPERVIOUS AS HE COULD BE
3983-5371-0008 A GREEN DANK DARK SLIMY SOUR STINKING POND HIS COAT TAILS WERE GONE BY THIS TIME AND SUNDRY RENTS AND DAMAGES APPEARED IN IN ANOTHER USEFUL GARMENT ONE PULLED HIM ANOTHER PUSHED HIM A THIRD SHOOK HIM BY THE COLLAR

40-121026-0005 THAN IF I POSSESSED A WATCH FOR THAT MIGHT BE BROKEN OR DERANGED IN ITS MOVEMENTS WHILE THE SUN AND EARTH NEVER VARY IN THEIR APPOINTED PATHS THIS LAST EXPLANATION WAS WHOLLY LOST UPON DANTES WHO HAD ALWAYS IMAGINED
40-121026-0012 AS WELL AS MAKE OUT THE SENSE IT BEING IN ITALIAN
40-121026-0019 AS THE WORKS OF THE SAVAGES IN THE SOUTH SEAS FROM WHENCE THEY HAD BEEN BROUGHT BY THE DIFFERENT TRADING VESSELS AS FOR THE INK
40-121026-0033 THAT A PERSON SO INTELLIGENT INGENIOUS AND CLEAR SIGHTED AS THE ABBE MIGHT PROBABLY BE ABLE TO SOLVE THE DARK MYSTERY OF HIS OWN MISFORTUNES WHERE HE HIMSELF COULD SEE NOTHING
40-121026-0040 I WOULD FAIN FIX THE SOURCE OF IT ON MAN THAT I MAY NO LONGER VENT REPROACHES UPON HEAVEN
40-222-0002 THE LIBERTY WHICH HER IMAGINATION HAD DARED TO TAKE WITH THE CHARACTER OF HIS FATHER COULD HE EVER FORGIVE IT THE ABSURDITY OF HER CURIOSITY AND HER FEARS COULD THEY EVER BE FORGOTTEN
40-222-0016 UPON SERIOUS CONSIDERATION TO BE NOT PERFECTLY AMIABLE HER MIND MADE UP ON THESE SEVERAL POINTS AND HER RESOLUTION FORMED OF ALWAYS JUDGING AND ACTING IN FUTURE WITH THE GREATEST GOOD SENSE
40-222-0023 HER ONLY DEPENDENCE FOR INFORMATION OF ANY KIND WAS ON ISABELLA JAMES HAD PROTESTED AGAINST WRITING TO HER TILL HIS RETURN TO OXFORD AND MISSUS ALLEN HAD GIVEN HER NO HOPES OF A LETTER TILL SHE HAD GOT BACK TO FULLERTON
40-222-0030 TILL THE VERY LAST IF I REASONED WITH HER SHE DECLARED HERSELF AS MUCH ATTACHED TO ME AS EVER
40-222-0044 IT CONTAINED SOMETHING WORSE THAN ANYBODY COULD SUPPOSE POOR JAMES IS SO UNHAPPY YOU WILL SOON KNOW WHY TO HAVE SO KIND HEARTED SO AFFECTIONATE A SISTER REPLIED HENRY WARMLY MUST BE A COMFORT TO HIM UNDER ANY DISTRESS
40-222-0051 WILL YOU TAKE THE TROUBLE OF READING TO US THE PASSAGES WHICH CONCERN MY BROTHER NO READ IT YOURSELF CRIED CATHERINE WHOSE SECOND THOUGHTS WERE CLEARER I DO NOT KNOW WHAT I WAS THINKING OF BLUSHING AGAIN THAT SHE HAD BLUSHED BEFORE
40-222-0058 IT IS ALL OVER WITH FREDERICK INDEED HE IS A DECEASED MAN DEFUNCT IN UNDERSTANDING PREPARE FOR YOUR SISTER IN LAW ELEANOR AND SUCH A SISTER IN LAW AS YOU MUST DELIGHT IN OPEN CANDID
4014-186175-0002 WAS SUFFICIENT TO PREVENT JERRY AND SLIM FROM TAKING A FULL EIGHT HOURS OF MUCH NEEDED SLEEP WHILE LIEUTENANT MACKINSON JOE AND THREE OTHER OFFICERS WHOM THE CAPTAIN HAD TAKEN INTO HIS CONFIDENCE IN THE MATTER FOLLOWED OUT EVERY POSSIBLE CLUE IN PURSUIT OF A SOLUTION OF THE BAFFLING MYSTERY
4014-186175-0016 THEY STOOD SILENT A MOMENT AND THEN FAINT AND INDISTINCT APPARENTLY FROM SOMEWHERE SEVERAL FEET AHEAD OF THEM THEY BOTH HEARD REPEATED THAT WHICH HAD MADE SLIM STOP
4014-186175-0030 NEARLY SUFFOCATED TOO
4014-186175-0037 THE SENIOR OFFICER OF THE VESSEL TOOK FROM HIS POCKET THE CROSS WITH ITS TWO BITS OF CHAIN STILL DANGLING FROM IT HE PLACED THE ENDS TO THE CHAIN WHICH JERRY HAD FOUND IN THE WIRELESS ROOM YOU ARE RIGHT HE SAID SIMPLY AND THERE COULD BE NO DOUBT ABOUT IT
4014-186176-0002 PRESUMABLY FROM THE ENGINE OR BOILER ROOM THROW ASIDE SOMETHING AS HE HURRIED ALONG THE PASSAGEWAY LEADING FROM THE WIRELESS ROOM
4014-186176-0016 AND TO DO THAT HE WILL HAVE TO USE THE WIRELESS SOMEHOW IT SEEMS LIKELY THAT HE WOULD MAKE HIS EFFORT AT NIGHT
4014-186176-0023 THERE WERE MUTUAL FEELINGS OF DISAPPOINTMENT BUT NONE OF WEAKENED DETERMINATION WHAT LUCK
4014-186176-0030 YE DIRTY HOUND I'VE A MIND TO BOOT YE INTO THE SEA
4014-186179-0000 THE FOLLOWING MORNING ALL OF THOSE WHO HAD ARRIVED ON THE TRANSPORTS WERE ESTABLISHED IN A CONCENTRATION CAMP BUT IT WAS MERELY FOR THE PURPOSE OF INSPECTION OF MEN AND EQUIPMENT AND WAS NOT TO BE FOR LONG
4014-186179-0007 HOSKINS KNOWS EXPLAINED RAWLE FOR HE GOT NEARER THAN I DID ONLY FOR A SHORT TIME FRANK CORRECTED MODESTLY BUT THEY CALLED IT MY BAPTISM OF FIRE I WAS OUT ONE NIGHT WITH AN ADVANCE PARTY WE WERE NEARLY AMBUSHED AND HAD TO BEAT A QUICK RETREAT
4014-186179-0014 AND FROM THEM THEY HEARD MANY SERIOUS AND AMUSING STORIES MANY TRUE TALES OF THE ATTACK AND RETREAT OF SHOT AND SHELL AND SHRAPNEL AND THE HAND GRENADE AND THE POISONOUS GAS BOMBS THROWN BY THE BOCHES AND THEN ONE BY ONE THE SOLDIERS OF UNCLE SAM DROPPED OFF INTO LONG
4014-186179-0028 AND THE LATTER IMMEDIATELY BEGAN A QUICK EXAMINATION OF HIS ENGINE AND TIRES WHICH PROMISED ANOTHER EARLY MOVE WE GO FORWARD AS FAR AS WE CAN BY AUTOMOBILE AGAIN THE LIEUTENANT INFORMED THEM
4014-186179-0035 YOU SHOULD LEAVE HERE ABOUT SEVEN O'CLOCK THIS EVENING IT IS NOW SIX FIFTEEN MINUTES LATER THEY HAD EXAMINED THEIR ARMS AND EQUIPPED THEMSELVES WITH A FULL SUPPLY OF SMALL ARMS AMMUNITION PORTABLE WIRELESS INSTRUMENT AND ANTENNAE AND THREE RATIONS EACH OF EATING CHOCOLATE
4014-186179-0042 FOR FULLY TEN MINUTES WHICH SEEMED LIKE AN HOUR THEY LAY THERE NOT DARING TO MOVE THEY WATCHED THE ENEMY SCOUTING PARTY GET A LIKE SCARE AND THEN AFTER WHAT SEEMED TO BE A WHISPERED CONSULTATION TURN BACK TO THE GERMAN LINES
4014-186183-0009 EVERY DETAIL OF THAT TREMENDOUS BATTLE JERRY KNEW HIS OWN OCCASIONAL GLIMPSES OVER THE SIDE INFORMED HIM OF THE TEMPORARY REVERSES HIS OWN ARMY WAS SUFFERING WHILE THE REMARKS OF THE OFFICER TOLD HIM WHERE THE GERMANS WERE MEETING THEIR BITTEREST REPULSES
4014-186183-0016 SO YOU CAN JUDGE PRETTY WELL FOR YOURSELF GUESS HE HAD A PRETTY GOOD BIRD'S EYE VIEW OF THE WHOLE THING SAID JOE AS THEY PASSED ON TO MEET AGAIN BEFORE MESS EXCEPT FOR SPASMODIC OUTBURSTS HERE AND THERE THE TRENCH DUEL HAD ALMOST ENTIRELY SUBSIDED
4014-186183-0023 STILL GOING AT MAXIMUM SPEED AND NOW ON A STRAIGHT LINE TOWARD THE AMERICAN SIDE WITHOUT SEEKING A FURTHER HEIGHT THE TAUBE SEVERAL TIMES WAVERED AND A MOMENT LATER ALMOST TURNED OVER BUT THE PILOT RIGHTED HER
4018-103416-0005 BUT AGAIN WASHINGTON KNEW THAT THE BRITISH AND FRENCH LOSSES AT THE SOMME HAD BEEN FRIGHTFUL THAT THE AMOUNT OF LOST TERRITORY REGAINED WAS NEGLIGIBLE AS AGAINST THE TERRITORY STILL HELD THAT THE FOOD PROBLEM IN THE BRITISH ISLANDS WAS ACUTE

4018-107312-0001 THE DIMENSIONS OF CASTLE STREET WERE NOT UNWORTHY OF THE METROPOLIS IT TRAVERSED A GREAT PORTION OF THE TOWN AND WAS PROPORTIONATELY WIDE ITS BROAD PAVEMENTS AND ITS BLAZING GAS LIGHTS INDICATED ITS MODERN ORDER AND PROSPERITY
4018-107312-0008 BY NARROW ARCHWAYS LIKE THE ENTRANCE OF HIVES SO LOW THAT YOU WERE OBLIGED TO STOOP FOR ADMISSION WHILE ASCENDING TO THESE SAME STREETS FROM THEIR DANK AND DISMAL DWELLINGS BY NARROW FLIGHTS OF STEPS
4018-107312-0021 WHAT MAKES HER DRINK BUT TOIL WORKING FROM FIVE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING TO SEVEN O'CLOCK AT NIGHT AND FOR THE LIKE OF SUCH AS YOU THAT'S A GOOD ONE SAID THE YOUTH I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHAT MY MOTHER EVER DID FOR ME BUT GIVE ME TREACLE AND LAUDANUM WHEN I WAS A BABBY

4018-107338-0018 YOU ARE RIGHT SAID MORLEY LOOKING AT HER RATHER KEENLY WE HAVE ALL OF US OPENED OURSELVES TOO UNRESERVEDLY BEFORE THIS ARISTOCRAT I SHOULD HOPE THAT NONE OF US HAVE SAID TO HIM A WORD THAT WE WISH TO BE FORGOTTEN SAID SYBIL
4018-107338-0025 LAWFULLY MEETING IN OPEN DAY AND THEIR DELEGATES FROM THE WHOLE REALM DECLARING THEIR GRIEVANCES IN LANGUAGE WHICH WOULD NOT DISGRACE THE CONQUERING RACE WHICH HAS IN VAIN ENDEAVOURED TO DEGRADE THEM
403-126855-0006 THOUGHT IT WOULD BE EASY FOR HIS ARMY TO FIND THEM BECAUSE THE DOCTOR WAS IN A STRANGE LAND AND WOULD NOT KNOW HIS WAY BUT HE WAS WRONG BECAUSE THE MONKEY CHEE CHEE KNEW ALL THE PATHS THROUGH THE JUNGLE BETTER EVEN THAN THE KING'S MEN DID
403-126855-0013 THEY WOULD SIT ROUND IT IN A RING LISTENING TO POLYNESIA SINGING SONGS ABOUT THE SEA OR TO CHEE CHEE TELLING STORIES OF THE JUNGLE AND MANY OF THE TALES THAT CHEE CHEE TOLD WERE VERY INTERESTING
403-126855-0020 AND HE SAW THE CAPTAIN OF THE ARMY SNEAKING THROUGH THE TREES SO HE HURRIED AFTER THE DOCTOR AND TOLD HIM TO RUN THEN THEY ALL RAN HARDER THAN THEY HAD EVER RUN IN THEIR LIVES AND THE KING'S MEN
403-128339-0002 CHARLES EVREMONDE CALLED DARNAY HAD REASON TO KNOW THE USAGE HE HAD SEEN HUNDREDS PASS AWAY SO
403-128339-0009 THE NIGHT IN ITS VERMIN HAUNTED CELLS WAS LONG AND COLD NEXT DAY FIFTEEN PRISONERS WERE PUT TO THE BAR BEFORE CHARLES DARNAY'S NAME WAS CALLED ALL THE FIFTEEN WERE CONDEMNED
403-128339-0016 UNDOUBTEDLY IT WAS WAS HE NOT AN EMIGRANT THEN WHAT DID HE CALL HIMSELF NOT AN EMIGRANT HE HOPED WITHIN THE SENSE AND SPIRIT OF THE LAW WHY NOT THE PRESIDENT DESIRED TO KNOW
403-128339-0030 BUT AS HE PROCEEDED AS HE SHOWED THAT THE ACCUSED WAS HIS FIRST FRIEND ON HIS RELEASE FROM HIS LONG IMPRISONMENT THAT THE ACCUSED HAD REMAINED IN ENGLAND ALWAYS FAITHFUL AND DEVOTED TO HIS DAUGHTER AND HIMSELF IN THEIR EXILE THAT
403-128339-0037 WITH THE SECOND PREDOMINATING NO SOONER WAS THE ACQUITTAL PRONOUNCED THAN TEARS WERE SHED AS FREELY AS BLOOD AT ANOTHER TIME AND SUCH FRATERNAL EMBRACES WERE BESTOWED UPON THE PRISONER BY AS MANY OF BOTH SEXES AS COULD RUSH AT HIM
403-128339-0044 UNTIL THE VERY TIDE OF THE RIVER ON THE BANK OF WHICH THE MAD SCENE WAS ACTED SEEMED TO RUN MAD LIKE THE PEOPLE ON THE SHORE THEY PUT HIM INTO A GREAT CHAIR THEY HAD AMONG THEM
403-216-0005 SHE WISHED BY A GENTLE REMONSTRANCE TO REMIND ISABELLA OF HER SITUATION AND MAKE HER AWARE OF THIS DOUBLE UNKINDNESS BUT FOR REMONSTRANCE EITHER OPPORTUNITY OR COMPREHENSION WAS ALWAYS AGAINST HER
403-216-0012 I HAVE MYSELF TOLD HIM THAT MISS THORPE IS ENGAGED HE KNOWS WHAT HE IS ABOUT AND MUST BE HIS OWN MASTER NO HE DOES NOT KNOW WHAT HE IS ABOUT CRIED CATHERINE HE DOES NOT KNOW THE PAIN HE IS GIVING MY BROTHER

405-130894-0004 THEREFORE LET'S CONCENTRATE ON OUR CHANCES OF BEING CRUSHED OR ASPHYXIATED AS FOR ASPHYXIATION CAPTAIN I REPLIED THAT ISN'T A CAUSE FOR ALARM BECAUSE THE AIR TANKS ARE FULL TRUE
405-130894-0011 WHICH WAS PROMPTLY ACCEPTED THE CANADIAN GOT INTO HIS UNDERWATER COSTUME AND WAS READY AS SOON AS HIS FELLOW WORKERS
405-130894-0018 THESE CHUNKS WEIGHED LESS THAN THE WATER AND BY AN UNUSUAL EFFECT OF SPECIFIC GRAVITY EACH CHUNK TOOK WING AS IT WERE TO THE ROOF OF THE TUNNEL
405-130894-0032 THIS LIFE GIVING ELASTIC FLUID COULD HAVE BEEN RESTORED TO US I HAD THOUGHT IT ALL OUT BUT TO NO AVAIL BECAUSE THE CARBON DIOXIDE PRODUCED BY OUR BREATHING PERMEATED EVERY PART OF THE SHIP TO ABSORB IT WE WOULD NEED TO FILL CONTAINERS WITH POTASSIUM HYDROXIDE
405-130894-0039 OR WE'LL BE SEALED UP IN THIS SOLIDIFIED WATER AS IF IT WERE CEMENT YES I SAID BUT WHAT CAN WE DO OH HE EXCLAIMED
405-130894-0046 BOILING WATER I EXCLAIMED YES SIR WE'RE SHUT UP IN A RELATIVELY CONFINED AREA IF THE NAUTILUS'S PUMPS CONTINUALLY INJECTED STREAMS OF BOILING WATER INTO THIS SPACE WOULDN'T THAT RAISE ITS TEMPERATURE AND DELAY ITS FREEZING

405-130894-0073 MY MUSCLES HAD NO POWER TO CONTRACT I'M UNABLE TO ESTIMATE THE HOURS THAT PASSED IN THIS WAY BUT I WAS AWARE THAT MY DEATH THROES HAD BEGUN I REALIZED THAT I WAS ABOUT TO DIE SUDDENLY I REGAINED CONSCIOUSNESS
405-130895-0008 AND YOU MY GALLANT CONSEIL YOU SUFFERED A GREAT DEAL NOT TOO MUCH TO BE CANDID WITH MASTER I WAS LACKING A FEW THROATFULS OF AIR BUT I WOULD HAVE GOTTEN BY
405-130895-0015 BY THEN ALL OUR PAST SUFFERINGS WERE FORGOTTEN THE MEMORY OF THAT IMPRISONMENT UNDER THE ICE FADED FROM OUR MINDS WE HAD THOUGHTS ONLY OF THE FUTURE
405-130895-0022 A PYRAMID SHAPED BLOCK OF SHALE WITH A VERY SHARP SUMMIT WHICH DEPENDING ON WHETHER IT'S CLEAR OR VEILED IN VAPOR PREDICTS FAIR WEATHER OR FOUL AS NED LAND TOLD ME A FIRST CLASS BAROMETER MY FRIEND
405-130895-0036 NEAR ELEVEN O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING WE CUT THE TROPIC OF CAPRICORN ON THE THIRTY SEVENTH MERIDIAN PASSING WELL OUT FROM CAPE FRIO MUCH TO NED LAND'S DISPLEASURE
4051-10927-0005 THAT SHE DID NOT CARE TO SAY A WORD ABOUT HERSELF MEANT A GREAT DEAL HE SAW THAT THE INMOST RECESSES OF HER SOUL THAT HAD ALWAYS HITHERTO LAIN OPEN BEFORE HIM WERE CLOSED AGAINST HIM MORE THAN THAT HE SAW FROM HER TONE
4051-10927-0012 HE HAD UNCONSCIOUSLY BECOME AGITATED OVER WHAT WAS THE AFFAIR OF HER CONSCIENCE AND WAS STRUGGLING AGAINST THE BARRIER HE FANCIED BETWEEN THEM
4051-10927-0026 SHE HEARD AN EVEN TRANQUIL SNORE FOR THE FIRST INSTANT ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH SEEMED AS IT WERE APPALLED AT HIS OWN SNORING AND CEASED BUT AFTER AN INTERVAL OF TWO BREATHINGS THE SNORE SOUNDED AGAIN
4051-11217-0005 AT ALL EVENTS TURN BACK WHO MAY I WILL NEVER SEE GREECE AGAIN UNLESS I CARRY WITH ME THE GOLDEN FLEECE WE WILL NONE OF US TURN BACK CRIED HIS NINE AND FORTY BRAVE COMRADES
4051-11217-0012 FOR CHIRON HAD TAUGHT HIM HOW TO BEHAVE WITH PROPRIETY WHETHER TO KINGS OR BEGGARS
4051-11217-0026 YET CAN NEVER BE CERTAIN WHETHER YOU SEE INTO THE FARTHEST DEPTHS OR WHETHER THERE BE NOT SOMETHING ELSE HIDDEN AT THE BOTTOM IF JASON HAD BEEN CAPABLE OF FEARING ANYTHING
4051-11217-0033 JUST AS THEY HAD BEEN PULLED OUT OF THE MONSTER'S JAWS BY CADMUS LONG AGO MEDEA THEN LED JASON DOWN THE PALACE STEPS AND THROUGH THE SILENT STREETS OF THE CITY AND INTO THE ROYAL PASTURE GROUND WHERE THE TWO BRAZEN FOOTED BULLS WERE KEPT IT WAS A STARRY NIGHT
4051-11217-0040 ONE OTHER STRIDE DID BOLD JASON MAKE AND SUDDENLY AS A STREAK OF LIGHTNING ON CAME THESE FIERY ANIMALS
4051-11218-0012 AND HOW IT WOULD HAVE REJOICED ANY GREAT CAPTAIN WHO WAS BENT ON CONQUERING THE WORLD LIKE ALEXANDER OR NAPOLEON TO RAISE A CROP OF ARMED SOLDIERS AS EASILY AS JASON DID
4051-11218-0019 FOR AN OFFENSE WHICH HE HIMSELF HAD COMMITTED IN AN INCREDIBLY SHORT SPACE OF TIME ALMOST AS SHORT INDEED AS IT HAD TAKEN THEM TO GROW UP ALL BUT ONE OF THE HEROES OF THE DRAGON'S TEETH WERE STRETCHED LIFELESS ON THE FIELD
4051-11218-0026 ENTERING THE PRESENCE CHAMBER HE STOOD AT THE FOOT OF THE THRONE AND MADE A LOW OBEISANCE YOUR EYES LOOK HEAVY PRINCE JASON OBSERVED THE KING YOU APPEAR TO HAVE SPENT A SLEEPLESS NIGHT
4051-11218-0040 LOWING NODDING THEIR HEADS AND THRUSTING FORTH THEIR SNOUTS WHICH AS OTHER CATTLE DO
4051-11218-0047 WHEN IT GLITTERS BEFORE YOUR EYES IT IS THE GOLDEN FLEECE JASON WENT ONWARD A FEW STEPS FARTHER AND THEN STOPPED TO GAZE O HOW BEAUTIFUL IT LOOKED SHINING WITH A MARVELOUS LIGHT OF ITS OWN THAT
4051-11218-0054 WHAT DO YOU THINK NOW OF YOUR PROSPECT OF WINNING THE GOLDEN FLEECE JASON ANSWERED ONLY BY DRAWING HIS SWORD AND MAKING A STEP FORWARD STAY FOOLISH YOUTH SAID MEDEA GRASPING HIS ARM
4088-158077-0005 AND BY THE RANK AND FILE OF MEN AND WOMEN NEVER IN HISTORY DID A BAND OF WOMEN STAND TOGETHER WITH MORE SANITY AND GREATER SOLIDARITY THAN DID THESE ONE THOUSAND DELEGATES REPRESENTING THOUSANDS MORE THROUGHOUT THE STATES AS OUR OFFICIAL ORGAN THE SUFFRAGIST
4088-158077-0012 FOR ONE PURPOSE ONLY TO SECURE AN AMENDMENT TO THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION ENFRANCHISING WOMEN WE DECLARED OFFICIALLY THROUGH OUR ORGAN THAT THIS HELD AS THE POLICY OF THE WOMAN'S PARTY WHATEVER TURN PUBLIC EVENTS MAY TAKE
4088-158077-0019 JUST AS OUR POLITICAL STRATEGY HAD BEEN TO OPPOSE AT ELECTIONS THE PARTY IN POWER WHICH HAD FAILED TO USE ITS POWER TO FREE WOMEN SO NOW OUR MILITARY STRATEGY WAS BASED ON THE MILITARY DOCTRINE OF CONCENTRATING ALL ONE'S FORCES ON THE ENEMY'S WEAKEST POINT
4088-158077-0032 AND INSTRUCTING THE CHAIRMAN OF THE CONVENTION TO REQUEST A COMMITTEE CONSISTING OF REPRESENTATIVES OF ALL LIBERAL GROUPS
4088-158077-0039 HOPING TO WIN BACK TO THE FOLD THE WANDERING PROGRESSIVES WHO HAD THUS DEMONSTRATED THEIR ALLEGIANCE TO SUFFRAGE AND SEEING AN OPPORTUNITY TO EMBARRASS THE ADMINISTRATION THE REPUBLICANS BEGAN TO INTEREST THEMSELVES IN ACTION ON THE AMENDMENT
4088-158077-0046 EVIDENTLY AROUSED PROTESTS FROM POWERFUL QUARTERS ALSO THE REPUBLICANS QUICKLY SUBSIDED WHEN THEY SAW THE DEMOCRATS MAKING AN ADVANCE AND SO THE DEMOCRATIC EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE BEGAN TO SPREAD ABROAD THE NEWS THAT ITS ACT WAS NOT REALLY OFFICIAL
4088-158077-0060 THE FIRST ARRESTS THE ADMINISTRATION CHOSE SUPPRESSION THEY RESORTED TO FORCE IN AN ATTEMPT TO END PICKETING IT WAS A POLICY DOOMED TO FAILURE AS CERTAINLY AS ALL RESORTS TO FORCE TO KILL AGITATION HAVE FAILED ULTIMATELY
4088-158077-0067 TWENTY MILLION AMERI CAN WOMEN ARE DENIED THE RIGHT TO VOTE PRESI DENT WILSON IS THE CHIEF OPPONENT OF THEIR NA TIONAL ENFRANCHISEMENT HELP US MAKE THIS NATION REALLY FREE TELL OUR GOVERNMENT IT MUST LIBERATE ITS PEOPLE BEFORE IT CAN CLAIM FREE RUSSIA AS AN ALLY
4088-158077-0074 BECAUSE WOMEN WERE HOLDING BANNERS ASKING FOR THE PRECIOUS PRINCIPLE AT HOME THAT MEN WERE SUPPOSED TO BE DYING FOR ABROAD FINALLY A DECISION WAS REACHED EMBODYING THE COMBINED WISDOM OF ALL THE VARIOUS CONFEREES
4088-158077-0088 INDEPENDENCE DAY JULY FOURTH NINETEEN SEVENTEEN IS THE OCCASION FOR TWO DEMONSTRATIONS IN THE NAME OF LIBERTY CHAMP CLARK LATE DEMOCRATIC SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE IS DECLAIMING TO A CHEERING CROWD BEHIND THE WHITE HOUSE

412-126975-0005 IF I MAKE MYSELF CLEAR IN THE GREEN LAWNS AND GREY TOWERS OF SOME CATHEDRAL TOWN SIMILARLY IN FRANCE WHEN I HAD GOT MONEY OUT OF A RICH AND WICKED PEASANT
412-126975-0012 OPENED ON THE GARDEN WITH THE MONKEY TREE AND A YOUNG GIRL CAME OUT WITH BREAD TO FEED THE BIRDS ON THE AFTERNOON OF BOXING DAY SHE HAD A PRETTY FACE WITH BRAVE BROWN EYES
412-126975-0026 AS THEY WENT TOGETHER THROUGH THE LAURELS TOWARDS THE FRONT GARDEN A MOTOR HORN SOUNDED THRICE COMING NEARER AND NEARER AND A CAR OF SPLENDID SPEED GREAT ELEGANCE
412-126975-0033 WERE UNWRAPPED ONE BY ONE TILL THEY REVEALED SOMETHING RESEMBLING THE HUMAN FORM THE FORM OF A FRIENDLY BUT FOREIGN LOOKING OLD GENTLEMAN WITH A GREY GOAT LIKE BEARD AND A BEAMING SMILE
412-126975-0040 WERE UNDULY LARGE IN PROPORTION TO THE HOUSE AND FORMED AS IT WERE A BIG ROOM WITH THE FRONT DOOR AT ONE END AND THE BOTTOM OF THE STAIRCASE AT THE OTHER IN FRONT OF THE LARGE HALL FIRE

412-126975-0068 WHAT I SAY IS LET'S DO SOMETHING FOR THE COMPANY TONIGHT NOT BLACKING FACES OR SITTING ON HATS IF YOU DON'T LIKE THOSE BUT SOMETHING OF THE SORT WHY COULDN'T WE HAVE A PROPER OLD ENGLISH PANTOMIME
412-126975-0082 YOU SEE AN ENGLISH INTERIOR OPEN A MOONLIT GARDEN IT ALL GOES BY MAGIC AND SNATCHING A CHANCE PIECE OF BILLIARD CHALK FROM HIS POCKET HE RAN IT ACROSS THE HALL FLOOR
412-126975-0089 SHE HAD WORN AT A FANCY DRESS PARTY AS THE QUEEN OF DIAMONDS INDEED HER UNCLE JAMES BLOUNT WAS GETTING ALMOST OUT OF HAND IN HIS EXCITEMENT HE WAS LIKE A SCHOOLBOY
4137-11701-0001 THAT'S WHAT MAKES IT SO JOLLY WE CAN DO WHAT WE LIKE AND IT DOESN'T MATTER IF IT DOESN'T COME OFF SO JUST FOR FUN LET'S THINK OF SOMETHING TO PAY HER OUT I FEEL I DON'T WANT TO HURT ANYBODY TO DAY ALL RIGHT WE WON'T HURT HER WE'LL HUMOUR HER
4137-11701-0015 UDO IS ONE OF MY OLDEST FRIENDS HE TURNED AND CLAPPED THAT BEWILDERED HIGHNESS ON THE BACK AREN'T YOU UDO AND I CAN THINK OF NO ONE MORE SUITABLE IN EVERY WAY HE BOWED AGAIN AND TURNED BACK TO THE PRINCE WELL UDO YOU'RE LOOKING SPLENDID
4137-11701-0022 MORE THAN ADVISER SHE GUESSED TO HYACINTH HER OWN POSITION WOULD NOT BE IN MUCH DOUBT AND AS FOR THE KING IT MIGHT BE MONTHS BEFORE HE CAME BACK AND WHEN HE DID COME WOULD HE REMEMBER HER
4137-11701-0029 SHE TOOK UNFLINCHING WHAT MUST HAVE BEEN THE BIGGEST SHOCK IN HER LIFE THEN PERHAPS I HAD BETTER SEE THAT EVERYTHING IS READY IN THE PALACE SHE SAID IF YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS WILL EXCUSE ME
4137-11701-0042 UDO EVIDENTLY HADN'T THOUGHT OF THIS HE TRIED TO SHOW THAT HE WAS NOT IN THE LEAST FRIGHTENED SHE COULDN'T DO ANYTHING
4137-11702-0003 HE HAD BEEN DISCOVERED BY THE CHIEF ARMOURER OF BARODIA AT FULL LENGTH ON THE WET GRASS SEARCHING FOR TRACKS THE CHIEF ARMOURER A KINDLY MAN
4137-11702-0017 HERE HE TURNED AND EMBRACED HIS DAUGHTER AGAIN AND IF HIS EYE TRAVELLED OVER HER SHOULDER IN THE DIRECTION OF BELVANE'S GARDEN IT IS A SMALL MATTER AND ONE FOR WHICH THE ARCHITECT OF THE CASTLE NO DOUBT WAS PRINCIPALLY TO BLAME
4137-11702-0024 BY THE WAY HE ADDED HENRY IS MARRYING AND SETTLING DOWN IN BARODIA IT IS CURIOUS HE WENT ON HOW AFTER A WAR ONE'S THOUGHTS TURN TO MATRIMONY HE GLANCED AT HIS DAUGHTER TO SEE HOW SHE WOULD TAKE THIS
4137-11702-0031 NOTHING MUCH I SUPPOSE HE WAITED NERVOUSLY WONDERING IF HYACINTH WOULD REALISE THAT ALL WAS MEANT TO INCLUDE MORE PARTICULARLY BELVANE HYACINTH DREW A STOOL UP TO HER FATHER'S CHAIR AND SAT DOWN VERY CLOSE TO HIM
4137-11702-0045 HE WOULD SAY THESE ARE MATTERS FOR MEN TO DISCUSS BUT HYACINTH WOULD KNOW QUITE WELL WHY SHE HAD BEEN SENT OUT AND WOULD CERTAINLY TELL CORONEL THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER AFTERWARDS IT REALLY LOOKED AS IF CORONEL WOULD HAVE TO BE LET INTO THE SECRET TOO
4137-11702-0052 THAT SAID CORONEL SIMPLY IS MUCH MORE SURPRISING MERRIWIG HOWEVER WAS NOT SO SURE OF THAT HE LIKED THE LOOK OF CORONEL HE LIKED HIS MANNER
4137-11702-0059 NO IT'S NOT THE PRINCESS ELVIRA SAID HYACINTH A LITTLE NERVOUSLY THE KING LAUGHED GOOD HUMOUREDLY AH WELL YOU MUST TELL ME HE SAID
4160-11549-0012 AND THEO'S MODEST EULOGIES OF HER LAST PIECE OF WORK HAD WON HER ADMIRATION AND REGARD AT ONCE CONSEQUENTLY UNDER STRESS OF MISS ELIZABETH THE CARRIAGE WAS FAIN TO DEPART MUCH TO THE ABASEMENT OF THE FAT GRAY COACHMAN WHO FELT HIMSELF MUCH DISHONORED IN FINDING HE WAS COMPELLED
4160-11549-0019 WE WERE NOT FOND OF MY BROTHER BENJAMIN'S WIFE SHE WAS A VERY GIDDY YOUNG PERSON AND VERY FOND OF GAYETY SHE DIED OF LUNG FEVER CONTRACTED THROUGH EXPOSING HERSELF ONE NIGHT AT A MILITARY BALL IN DIRECT OPPOSITION TO MY BROTHER BENJAMIN'S WISHES
4160-11549-0026 THE DAY PASSED PLEASANTLY ENOUGH HOWEVER IN A QUIET WAY MISS ELIZABETH WAS VERY AFFECTIONATE AND COMMUNICATIVE AND TOLD HER A GREAT MANY STORIES OF ANASTASIA AND THE LATE LAMENTED BENJAMIN AS THEY SAT BY THE FIRE TOGETHER IN THE EVENING AND BLUNDERED OVER THE OCTAGON STITCH
4160-11550-0001 IT WAS MIDNIGHT AFTER THE MEMORABLE DAY SPENT IN BROOME STREET THAT THE RECORD WAS MADE AND HAVING MADE IT THEODORA NORTH SHUT THE BOOK WITH A STARTLED FEELING THAT SHE HAD SHUT WITHIN ITS PAGES AN UNFINISHED PAGE OF HER LIFE IT WAS A STRANGE FEELING TO HAVE COME UPON HER SO SUDDENLY
4160-11550-0008 AND WONDERED GUILELESSLY HOW MATTERS COULD END WITH PERFECT JUSTICE TO PRISCILLA GOWER THE HOUSEHOLD SEEMED RATHER QUIET AFTER THE CHANGE MISTER DENIS OGLETHORPE WAS A MAN TO BE MISSED UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES AND THEO WAS NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO MISSED HIM
4160-11550-0015 NO SHE REPLIED ALMOST TIMIDLY PAMELA IS FAIRER THAN I AM AND NOT SO TALL WE ARE NOT ALIKE AT ALL I WAS NOT THINKING OF THAT SAID PRISCILLA I WAS WONDERING IF YOU WERE ALIKE IN DISPOSITION I THINK I WAS WONDERING MOST WHETHER YOU WOULD BE AS FAITHFUL AS PAMELA
4160-11550-0029 AND WENT BACK TO THE PARLOR TO KISS MISS ELIZABETH IN A STRANGE FRAME OF MIND SHE WAS BEGINNING TO FEEL MORE STRANGELY CONCERNING MISTER DENIS OGLETHORPE AND IT WAS PRISCILLA GOWER WHO HAD STIRRED HER HEART SHE FOUND LADY THROCKMORTON WAITING AT HOME FOR HER TO HER SURPRISE IN A NEW MOOD
4160-11550-0036 SHE WAS ACTUALLY GIRLISH AND SENSITIVE ENOUGH TO FANCY THAT MISTER DENIS OGLETHORPE MIGHT IMAGINE THEIR INTENTION TO FOLLOW HIM WAS SOME FAULT OF HERS AND SHE WAS UNCOMFORTABLE AND NERVOUS ACCORDINGLY SHE HOPED HE WOULD HAVE LEFT VIENNA BEFORE THE LETTER REACHED HIM SHE HOPED HE MIGHT GO AWAY IN SPITE OF IT
4160-14187-0003 THOUGH VERY DISREPUTABLE TO LOOK AT JUST CAME A CROPPER IN THE MUD JERVIS HE ADDED AS HE NOTED MY DISMAYED EXPRESSION DINNER AND A CLOTHES BRUSH ARE WHAT I CHIEFLY NEED NEVERTHELESS HE LOOKED VERY PALE AND SHAKEN WHEN HE CAME INTO THE LIGHT ON THE LANDING
4160-14187-0017 WHICH HAS BEEN FASTENED UPON EAGERLY BY THE POLICE WHO HAVE NATURALLY BEEN DELIGHTED AT OBTAINING A SORT OF MAGIC TOUCHSTONE BY WHICH THEY ARE SAVED THE LABOUR OF INVESTIGATION BUT THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A SINGLE FACT THAT AFFORDS EVIDENCE REQUIRING NO CORROBORATION
4160-14187-0024 AS THE CASE STANDS THE BALANCE OF PROBABILITIES MAY BE STATED THUS JOHN HORNBY UNDOUBTEDLY HAD ACCESS TO THE DIAMONDS AND THEREFORE MIGHT HAVE STOLEN THEM BUT IF THE THUMB MARK WAS MADE AFTER HE CLOSED THE SAFE AND BEFORE HE OPENED IT AGAIN
4195-17507-0002 OR AT LEAST IL DESERTO THE OTHERS STOOD BY TO LISTEN SILENTLY TO THE DISCUSSION YIELDING FIRST PLACE TO THE VICTOR IN THE RACE UNCLE JOHN WAS OBDURATE ALL WE WANT TO DAY IS TO SEE THE TOWN HE DECLARED WE'RE NOT GOING TO RIDE BUT WALK

4195-17507-0023 AND HAS NO DUPLICATE IN ALL THE KNOWN WORLD
4195-17507-0030 AT THIS CRITICAL MOMENT A MOUNTED HORSEMAN WHO UNOBSERVED HAD BEEN FOLLOWING THE PARTY DASHED TO THEIR RESCUE THE RIDER CAUGHT THE PLUNGING STEEDS BY THEIR HEADS AND TRIED TO RESTRAIN THEIR TERROR AT HIS OWN EMINENT PERIL
4195-17507-0043 COUNT FERRALTI RODE AT THE SIDE OF THE CARRIAGE BUT DID NOT ATTEMPT MUCH CONVERSATION
4195-186236-0001 BEING SERVED BY THE OLD SERVANTS AS A MERE MATTER OF ROUTINE INDEED THE ARRANGEMENTS OF THE HOUSEHOLD HAD BEEN CONSIDERABLY CHANGED BY THE DEATH OF ITS MISTRESS AND WITHOUT ANY REAL HEAD TO DIRECT THEM THE SERVANTS WERE PATIENTLY AWAITING THE ADVENT OF A NEW MASTER OR MISTRESS
4195-186236-0008 AND THEN SHE WENT TO BED AND SLEPT PEACEFULLY
4195-186236-0022 LOUISE SMILED RATHER SCORNFULLY AND BETH SCOWLED MY MOTHER AND I LIVE SO SIMPLY IN OUR LITTLE FLAT SAID ONE THAT WE REALLY HAVEN'T EXTRA ROOM TO KEEP A CAT BUT WE SHALL BE GLAD TO ASSIST UNCLE JOHN AS FAR AS WE ARE ABLE
4195-186237-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY FOUR HOME AGAIN THE MAJOR WAS AT THE STATION TO MEET THEM
4195-186237-0007 I FOUGHT WITH AUNT JANE LIKE A PIRATE AND IT QUITE WON HER HEART WHEN SHE DIED SHE LEFT ME ALL SHE HAD IN THE WORLD LOOK AT THAT NOW SAID THE MAJOR WONDERINGLY WHICH TURNED OUT TO BE NOTHING AT ALL CONTINUED PATSY

4195-186237-0028 UNCLE JOHN LAUGHED AND DREW HIS CHAIR UP TO THE TABLE THEN HE EMPTIED HIS TROUSERS POCKETS UPON THE CLOTH AND PATSY GRAVELY SEPARATED THE KEYS AND JACKKNIFE FROM THE COINS AND PROCEEDED TO COUNT THE MONEY SEVEN DOLLARS AND FORTY TWO CENTS SHE ANNOUNCED ANY MORE
4195-186238-0001 TO PASS THE TIME HE TURNED INTO A SMALL RESTAURANT AND HAD COFFEE AND A PLATE OF CAKES IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT PATSY HAD SO RECENTLY PREPARED COFFEE OVER THE SHEET IRON STOVE AND BROUGHT SOME HOT BUNS FROM A NEAR BY BAKERY HE WAS NOT ESPECIALLY HUNGRY BUT IN SIPPING THE COFFEE AND NIBBLING THE CAKES
4195-186238-0015 BESIDES THE CHECK BOOK WHICH WAS CAREFULLY HIDDEN AWAY IN AN INSIDE POCKET SO THE COST OF THE CAB DID NOT WORRY HIM
4195-186238-0022 WE'RE DREADFULLY RICH UNCLE JOHN SO YOU NEEDN'T WORRY IF YOU DON'T STRIKE A JOB YOURSELF ALL AT ONCE ANY LUCK TODAY SIR ASKED THE MAJOR TUCKING A NAPKIN UNDER HIS CHIN AND BEGINNING ON THE SOUP UNCLE JOHN SHOOK HIS HEAD OF COURSE NOT SAID PATSY QUICKLY IT'S TOO EARLY AS YET
4214-7146-0001 WHEN THE BIRCHES IN THE HOLLOW TURNED AS GOLDEN AS SUNSHINE AND THE MAPLES BEHIND THE ORCHARD WERE ROYAL CRIMSON AND THE WILD CHERRY TREES ALONG THE LANE PUT ON THE LOVELIEST SHADES OF DARK RED AND BRONZY GREEN WHILE THE FIELDS SUNNED THEMSELVES IN AFTERMATHS
4214-7146-0015 ANNE FLEW DOWN TO THE HOLLOW PAST THE DRYAD'S BUBBLE AND UP THE SPRUCE PATH TO ORCHARD SLOPE TO ASK DIANA TO TEA AS A RESULT JUST AFTER MARILLA HAD DRIVEN OFF TO CARMODY DIANA CAME OVER DRESSED IN HER SECOND BEST DRESS AND LOOKING EXACTLY AS IT IS PROPER TO LOOK WHEN ASKED OUT TO TEA

4214-7146-0029 THERE ARE SO MANY RESPONSIBILITIES ON A PERSON'S MIND WHEN THEY'RE KEEPING HOUSE ISN'T THERE
4214-7146-0043 OH DIANA I SHALL NEVER FORGET THAT AWFUL MOMENT IF I LIVE TO BE A HUNDRED MISSUS CHESTER ROSS JUST LOOKED AT ME AND I THOUGHT I WOULD SINK THROUGH THE FLOOR WITH MORTIFICATION
4214-7146-0050 GOT DIANA'S HAT AND WENT WITH HER AS FAR AS THE BARRY YARD FENCE THEN SHE WEPT ALL THE WAY BACK TO GREEN GABLES WHERE SHE SORROWFULLY PUT THE REMAINDER OF THE RASPBERRY CORDIAL BACK INTO THE PANTRY AND GOT TEA READY FOR MATTHEW AND JERRY WITH ALL THE ZEST GONE OUT OF THE PERFORMANCE
4214-7146-0057 NOT EVEN IF THEY DRANK THREE BIG TUMBLERFULS AS DIANA DID OH IT SOUNDS SO SO LIKE MISSUS THOMAS'S HUSBAND BUT I DIDN'T MEAN TO SET HER DRUNK DRUNK FIDDLESTICKS SAID MARILLA MARCHING TO THE SITTING ROOM PANTRY
4214-7146-0071 MISSUS BARRY COMING TO THE DOOR IN ANSWER TO A TIMID KNOCK FOUND A WHITE LIPPED EAGER EYED SUPPLIANT ON THE DOORSTEP HER FACE HARDENED MISSUS BARRY WAS A WOMAN OF STRONG PREJUDICES AND DISLIKES AND HER ANGER WAS OF THE COLD SULLEN SORT WHICH IS ALWAYS HARDEST TO OVERCOME
4214-7146-0078 MY LAST HOPE IS GONE SHE TOLD MARILLA I WENT UP AND SAW MISSUS BARRY MYSELF AND SHE TREATED ME VERY INSULTINGLY MARILLA I DO NOT THINK SHE IS A WELL BRED WOMAN THERE IS NOTHING MORE TO DO EXCEPT TO PRAY
426-122819-0004 I SAID SOME DREADFUL THINGS TO MISSUS LYNDE LONG AGO BUT IT WAS WHEN I HAD LOST MY TEMPER I COULDN'T SAY THEM DELIBERATELY IT WAS THE TRUTH AND I BELIEVE IN TELLING THE TRUTH TO EVERYBODY

426-122819-0032 THE LUCKLESS IMPROVERS EXPECTED THAT AVONLEA WOULD BE MORE PREJUDICED THAN EVER AGAINST THEM BUT INSTEAD PUBLIC SYMPATHY VEERED AROUND IN THEIR FAVOR
426-122821-0008 I WISH YOU COULD SEE SOME OF THEIR COMPOSITIONS SO MUCH DO I WISH IT THAT I'LL SEND YOU COPIES OF SOME WRITTEN RECENTLY LAST WEEK I TOLD THE FOURTH CLASS I WANTED THEM TO WRITE ME LETTERS ABOUT ANYTHING THEY PLEASED ADDING BY WAY OF SUGGESTION THAT THEY MIGHT TELL ME OF SOME PLACE THEY HAD VISITED

426-122822-0000 A JONAH DAY IT REALLY BEGAN THE NIGHT BEFORE WITH A RESTLESS WAKEFUL VIGIL OF GRUMBLING TOOTHACHE WHEN ANNE AROSE IN THE DULL BITTER WINTER MORNING SHE FELT THAT LIFE WAS FLAT STALE AND UNPROFITABLE
426-122822-0007 ANNE CAUGHT HIM IN THE ACT AND JUMPED TO A FATAL CONCLUSION ABOUT THAT PARCEL OLD MISSUS HIRAM SLOANE HAD LATELY TAKEN TO MAKING AND SELLING NUT CAKES BY WAY OF ADDING TO HER SCANTY INCOME THE CAKES WERE SPECIALLY TEMPTING TO SMALL BOYS
426-122822-0021 EVEN THE STORMY SOULED ANNE SHE WAS AT THAT MOMENT COULD NOT HAVE PUNISHED ANY CHILD CRUELLY BUT THE POINTER NIPPED KEENLY AND FINALLY ANTHONY'S BRAVADO FAILED HIM HE WINCED AND THE TEARS CAME TO HIS EYES ANNE CONSCIENCE STRICKEN DROPPED THE POINTER AND TOLD ANTHONY TO GO TO HIS SEAT
426-122822-0028 HE IS THE ONLY ONE I CAN'T HELP IT I WANT EVERYBODY TO LOVE ME AND IT HURTS ME SO WHEN ANYBODY DOESN'T AND ANTHONY NEVER WILL NOW OH I JUST MADE AN IDIOT OF MYSELF TODAY MARILLA I'LL TELL YOU THE WHOLE STORY

4267-287369-0020 FITFUL FLASHES OF LIGHTNING COULD BE SEEN FORKING ACROSS THE SKY IN JAGGED CHAINS OF PURPLE LIGHT IT'S GOING TO BE A HEAVY STORM TOM ADMITTED TO HIMSELF
4267-287369-0027 AND THE CAMPFIRE BURNED STEADILY ALL AT ONCE THERE WAS A CRASH AS IF THE VERY MOUNTAIN HAD SPLIT ASUNDER AND THE ADVENTURERS SAW A GREAT BALL OF PURPLE BLUISH FIRE SHOOT DOWN
4267-72637-0003 THEY WERE CROWDED AND WE WERE TURNED FROM THE HOSPITABLE DOOR WE THEN MADE A TOUR OF THE INNS BUT NOT A SINGLE ROOM WAS TO BE HAD NOT FOR THAT NIGHT NOR FOR TWO DAYS AHEAD ON ACCOUNT OF THAT SAME ELECTION HADN'T WE BETTER GO ON TO EDINBURGH
4267-72637-0010 I HAVE A PLAN TO PROPOSE I WAS HERE LAST SUMMER WITH A COUPLE OF HARVARD MEN AND WE LODGED AT A FARMHOUSE ABOUT A MILE DISTANT FROM THE CATHEDRAL IF YOU WILL STEP INTO THE COFFEE ROOM FOR AN HOUR
4267-72637-0017 DURHAM JULY NINETEENTH
4267-72637-0031 I DID NOT FACILITATE THE PREPARATIONS AND A MOMENT OF AWKWARD SILENCE ENSUED MIGHT I INQUIRE I ASKED IF THE DEAR LITTLE PERSON AT PRESENT REPOSING IN MY ARMS WILL STAY THERE WITH INTERVALS FOR REST AND REFRESHMENT
4267-78186-0002 THE OLD MINISTER HAD AN ORCHARD OF MOST PARTICULAR GOOD FRUIT FOR HE WAS A GREAT HAND AT BUDDIN GRAFTIN AND WHAT NOT AND THE ORCHARD IT WAS ON THE SOUTH SIDE OF THE HOUSE STRETCHED RIGHT UP TO THE ROAD WELL

4267-78186-0023 AS THE DOOR CLOSED MISTER SLICK SAID IT'S A PITY SHE DON'T GO WELL IN GEAR THE DIFFICULTY WITH THOSE CRITTERS IS TO GIT THEM TO START ARTER THAT THERE IS NO TROUBLE WITH THEM IF YOU DON'T CHECK EM TOO SHORT IF YOU DO THEY'LL STOP AGAIN
4267-78186-0030 I NEVER KNOWED BUT ONE CASE OF A BROKEN HEART AND THAT WAS IN T'OTHER SEX ONE WASHINGTON BANKS HE WAS A SNEEZER HE WAS TALL ENOUGH TO SPIT DOWN ON THE HEADS OF YOUR GRENADIERS AND NEAR ABOUT HIGH ENOUGH TO WADE ACROSS CHARLESTOWN RIVER
4267-78186-0037 THE FORE PART OF THE SUMMER WITH LEFTENANT OBY KNOWLES THAT I COULD SHOULDER THE BEST BOWER OF THE CONSTITUTION FRIGATE I WON MY BET BUT THE ANCHOR WAS SO ETARNAL HEAVY THAT IT BROKE MY HEART
4297-13006-0013 OR IF HER TASTES LIE IN THAT DIRECTION A RICH MAN EMILY WHARTON HAD DOUBTLESS THOUGHT ABOUT THESE THINGS AND SHE SINCERELY BELIEVED THAT SHE HAD FOUND THE GOOD MAN IN FERDINAND LOPEZ

4297-13006-0027 DISREPUTABLE YOU MAY SAY THAT OF ANY MAN PAPA BUT WHEN A MAN HAS CONNEXIONS A FATHER AND MOTHER OR UNCLES AND AUNTS PEOPLE THAT EVERYBODY KNOWS ABOUT THEN THERE IS SOME GUARANTEE OF SECURITY
4297-13006-0040 IT WILL BE A CRUSHING BLOW HE LOOKED AT HER AND SAW THAT THERE WAS A FIXED PURPOSE IN HER COUNTENANCE OF WHICH HE HAD NEVER BEFORE SEEN SIMILAR SIGNS YOU CLAIM A RIGHT TO MY OBEDIENCE AND I ACKNOWLEDGE IT
4297-13009-0002 FOR LEGAL OFFICES HAVE A SIGNIFICATION DIFFERING MUCH FROM THAT WHICH ATTACHES ITSELF TO PLACES SIMPLY POLITICAL A LORD CHANCELLOR BECOMES A PEER AND ON GOING OUT OF OFFICE ENJOYS A LARGE PENSION WHEN THE WOOLSACK HAS BEEN REACHED THERE COMES AN END OF DOUBT
4297-13009-0009 ONE ON THE HEELS OF THE OTHER EACH ASSURING ME NOT ONLY THAT THE WHOLE STABILITY OF THE ENTERPRISE DEPENDS ON MY GIVING A CERTAIN OFFICE TO HIM BUT ACTUALLY TELLING ME TO MY FACE THAT I HAD PROMISED IT TO HIM THE OLD STATESMAN LAUGHED

4297-13009-0051 YOU DO NOT KNOW HOW CONSTANTLY I CARRY YOU ABOUT WITH ME YOU CARRY A VERY UNNECESSARY BURDEN THEN SHE SAID BUT HE COULD TELL AT ONCE FROM THE ALTERED TONE OF HER VOICE AND FROM THE LIGHT OF HER EYE AS HE GLANCED INTO HER FACE

4340-15220-0041 SMOOTHING AWAY ALL OBJECTIONS FOR HE LIKED BEN AND SAW THAT HE WANTED TO GO NO I WON'T I DON'T LIKE HIM HE WINKS AT ME AND GROWLS WHEN I TOUCH HIM MUTTERED NAUGHTY CY REMEMBERING HOW MUCH REASON POOR SANCH HAD TO DISTRUST HIS TORMENTOR

4340-15220-0055 GIRLS ARE SUCH A BOTHER WHEN YOU WANT TO KNOCK ROUND NO BAB YOU CAN'T GO TRAVEL RIGHT HOME AND DON'T MAKE A FUSS COME ALONG BOYS
4340-15220-0069 AND BOTH SUPPRESSED AN ASTONISHED HULLO FOR THERE STOOD BAB WAITING FOR SANCHO TO LAP HIS FILL OUT OF THE OVERFLOWING TROUGH SUCH A SHABBY TIRED LOOKING COUPLE AS THEY WERE
4340-15220-0076 TRYING TO PULL HIM AFTER HER AS SHE TRUDGED ON BOUND TO SEE THE OUTSIDE OF THAT WONDERFUL TENT EVEN IF SHE NEVER GOT IN BUT SANCHO HAD HEARD A SOFT CHIRRUP AND WITH A SUDDEN BOUND TWITCHED THE STRAP AWAY SPRANG UP THE BANK

4340-15220-0097 WELL HE WON'T LIKE THAT NOR YOU EITHER
4362-15663-0003 THE FIRST RAINS HAD FALLEN ON THE LOWLANDS AND THE FIRST SNOWS ON THE MOUNTAINS AND EVERYTHING WAS FRESH AND BRACING WHILE AN ABUNDANCE OF BALMY SUNSHINE FILLED ALL THE NOONDAY HOURS
4362-15663-0010 THE SNOW WAS TOO LOOSE AND DEEP TO CLIMB AND I SHOULD BE LOST IN DRIFTS AND SLIDES WHEN I HINTED THAT NEW SNOW WAS BEAUTIFUL AND STORMS NOT SO BAD AS THEY WERE CALLED MY ADVISERS SHOOK THEIR HEADS IN TOKEN OF SUPERIOR KNOWLEDGE
4362-15663-0024 I FREQUENTLY SANK TO MY ARMPITS BETWEEN BURIED BLOCKS OF LOOSE LAVA BUT GENERALLY ONLY TO MY KNEES WHEN TIRED WITH WALKING I STILL WALLOWED SLOWLY UPWARD ON ALL FOURS THE STEEPNESS OF THE SLOPE
4362-15663-0031 I REACHED CAMP ABOUT AN HOUR BEFORE DUSK HOLLOWED A STRIP OF LOOSE GROUND IN THE LEE OF A LARGE BLOCK OF RED LAVA WHERE FIREWOOD WAS ABUNDANT ROLLED MYSELF IN MY BLANKETS AND WENT TO SLEEP NEXT MORNING
4362-15663-0038 THE WIND SWEPT PAST IN HISSING FLOODS GRINDING THE SNOW INTO MEAL AND SWEEPING DOWN INTO THE HOLLOWS IN ENORMOUS DRIFTS ALL THE HEAVIER PARTICLES WHILE THE FINER DUST WAS SIFTED THROUGH THE SKY INCREASING THE ICY GLOOM
4362-15663-0051 IN THE MEAN TIME CLOUDS WERE GROWING DOWN IN SHASTA VALLEY MASSIVE SWELLING CUMULI DISPLAYING DELICIOUS TONES OF PURPLE AND GRAY IN THE HOLLOWS OF THEIR SUN BEATEN BOSSES EXTENDING GRADUALLY SOUTHWARD AROUND ON BOTH SIDES OF SHASTA
4362-15663-0065 THE STORM BEGAN IN SERIOUS EARNEST AT FIRST THE CLIFFS WERE BEATEN WITH HAIL EVERY STONE OF WHICH AS FAR AS I COULD SEE WAS REGULAR IN FORM SIX SIDED PYRAMIDS WITH ROUNDED BASE RICH AND SUMPTUOUS LOOKING AND FASHIONED WITH LOVING CARE
4362-15663-0079 SOME CRYSTALS LANDED WITH THEIR RAYS ALMOST PERFECT BUT MOST OF THEM WERE WORN AND BROKEN BY STRIKING AGAINST ONE ANOTHER OR BY ROLLING ON THE GROUND THE TOUCH OF THESE SNOW FLOWERS IN CALM WEATHER IS INFINITELY GENTLE GLINTING SWAYING
4362-15663-0086 EVEN SHOULD HIS SUFFERINGS ADMIT OF SUCH A THING ACCORDINGLY WHEN DURING THE LONG DREARY WATCHES OF THE NIGHT WE ROUSED FROM A STATE OF HALF CONSCIOUSNESS WE CALLED EACH OTHER BY NAME IN A FRIGHTENED STARTLED WAY
4362-15663-0093 IN ABOUT THIRTEEN HOURS EVERY HOUR LIKE A YEAR DAY BEGAN TO DAWN BUT IT WAS LONG ERE THE SUMMIT'S ROCKS WERE TOUCHED BY THE SUN NO CLOUDS WERE VISIBLE FROM WHERE WE LAY YET THE MORNING WAS DULL AND BLUE AND BITTERLY FROSTY
4397-15666-0000 THE GREATER PORTION OF THE CALENDAR SPRINGTIME OF UTAH HAS BEEN WINTER IN ALL THE UPPER CANYONS OF THE MOUNTAINS THE SNOW IS NOW FROM FIVE TO TEN FEET DEEP OR MORE AND MOST OF IT HAS FALLEN SINCE MARCH
4397-15666-0007 AND THEIR MARVELOUS PROFUSION OF ORNATE SCULPTURE WERE MOST IMPRESSIVELY MANIFEST ONE WOULD FANCY THAT A MAN MIGHT BE CLEARLY SEEN WALKING ON THE SNOW AT A DISTANCE OF TWENTY OR THIRTY MILES WHILE WE WERE REVELING IN THIS RARE UNGARISH GRANDEUR
4397-15666-0014 THE CRYSTAL FLAKES FALLING IN THE FOUL STREETS WAS A PITIFUL SIGHT NOTWITHSTANDING THE VAUNTED REFINING INFLUENCES OF TOWNS PURITY OF ALL KINDS PURE HEARTS PURE STREAMS PURE SNOW
4397-15668-0001 BUT YOU MAY NOT SEE A SINGLE TRUE LILY AND ONLY A VERY FEW LILIACEOUS PLANTS OF ANY KIND NOT EVEN IN THE COOL FRESH GLENS OF THE MOUNTAINS WILL YOU FIND THESE FAVORITE FLOWERS THOUGH SOME OF THESE DESERT RANGES ALMOST RIVAL THE SIERRA IN HEIGHT
4397-15668-0008 AND OVER ALL THE SMOOTH CROWN OF SNOW WHILE STANDING AT THEIR FEET THE OTHER DAY SHORTLY AFTER MY MEMORABLE EXCURSION AMONG THE SALT WAVES OF THE LAKE I SAID NOW I SHALL HAVE ANOTHER BAPTISM
4397-15668-0015 ON THE UPPER SIDE WHERE THE BUSHES WERE MORE OPEN BUT A COMPANY COMPOSED OF THE TWO LILIES I HAVE MENTIONED WERE BLOOMING ON THE LOWER SIDE AND THOUGH THEY WERE AS YET OUT OF SIGHT I SUDDENLY CHANGED MY MIND AND WENT DOWN TO MEET THEM
4397-15668-0028 LYING THIRTY FIVE MILES TO THE SOUTH WAS IN FULL SIGHT ALSO AND THE RIVER JORDAN WHICH LINKS THE TWO TOGETHER MAY BE TRACED IN SILVERY GLEAMS THROUGHOUT ITS WHOLE COURSE
4397-15668-0035 AND THROUGHOUT ONE HUNGRY WINTER IN PARTICULAR THOUSANDS OF THE PEOPLE SUBSISTED CHIEFLY ON THE BULBS OF THE TULIPS CALLED SEGO BY THE INDIANS WHO TAUGHT THEM ITS USE LILIACEOUS WOMEN AND GIRLS ARE RARE AMONG THE MORMONS
4397-15678-0002 MAKING HIS WAY WITH THE SKILL OF WILD ANIMALS ALL HIS SENSES IN ACTION WATCHFUL AND ALERT LOOKING KEENLY AT EVERYTHING IN SIGHT HIS IMAGINATION WELL NOURISHED IN THE WEALTH OF THE WILDERNESS COMING INTO CONTACT WITH FREE NATURE IN A THOUSAND FORMS
4397-15678-0016 PAVED BROADWAYS AND BOULEVARDS SUBSTANTIAL BUSINESS BLOCKS SCHOOLS CHURCHES FACTORIES AND FOUNDRIES THE LUSTY TITANIC CLANG OF BOILER MAKING MAY BE HEARD THERE
4397-15678-0023 BUILDING BUYING BORROWING TO PUSH THE COUNTRY TO ITS PLACE KEEPING ARITHMETIC BUSY IN COUNTING POPULATION PRESENT AND TO COME SHIPS TOWNS FACTORIES TONS OF COAL AND IRON FEET OF LUMBER MILES OF RAILROAD
4397-15678-0030 THIRTY OR FORTY MILES EASTWARD FROM SEATTLE
4406-16882-0000 BELONGING TO OUR GARRISON BUT NONE OF THEM WOULD STIR THOUGH ANOTHER TIME IF ANY INDIAN HAD COME TO THE DOOR THEY WERE READY TO FLY UPON HIM AND TEAR HIM DOWN THE LORD HEREBY WOULD MAKE US THE MORE ACKNOWLEDGE HIS HAND AND TO SEE THAT OUR HELP IS ALWAYS IN HIM
4406-16882-0007 OH THE DOLEFUL SIGHT THAT NOW WAS TO BEHOLD AT THIS HOUSE COME BEHOLD THE WORKS OF THE LORD
4406-16882-0014 SOME ROASTING SOME LYING AND BURNING AND SOME BOILING TO FEED OUR MERCILESS ENEMIES WHO WERE JOYFUL ENOUGH THOUGH WE WERE DISCONSOLATE
4406-16882-0028 MY WOUNDS STINK AND ARE CORRUPT I AM TROUBLED I AM BOWED DOWN GREATLY I GO MOURNING ALL THE DAY LONG I SAT MUCH ALONE WITH A POOR WOUNDED CHILD IN MY LAP WHICH MOANED NIGHT AND DAY HAVING NOTHING TO REVIVE THE BODY OR CHEER THE SPIRITS OF HER BUT INSTEAD OF THAT
4406-16882-0035 SHE WAS ABOUT TEN YEARS OLD AND TAKEN FROM THE DOOR AT FIRST BY A PRAYING INDIANA AND AFTERWARD SOLD FOR A GUN
4406-16882-0042 AND EVERY TIME THAT THE OTHER WENT OVER THEIR NUMBER THESE AT HOME GAVE A SHOUT THAT THE VERY EARTH RUNG AGAIN AND THUS THEY CONTINUED TILL THOSE THAT HAD BEEN UPON THE EXPEDITION WERE COME UP TO THE SAGAMORE'S WIGWAM AND THEN
4406-16882-0055 AND THEN THEY MADE A STOP AND CHOSE SOME OF THEIR STOUTEST MEN AND SENT THEM BACK TO HOLD THE ENGLISH ARMY IN PLAY WHILST THE REST ESCAPED AND THEN LIKE JEHU THEY MARCHED ON FURIOUSLY WITH THEIR OLD AND WITH THEIR YOUNG SOME CARRIED THEIR OLD DECREPIT MOTHERS
4406-16883-0000 AND THE CHANGE THAT HAD COME UPON US WE HAD HUSBAND AND FATHER AND CHILDREN AND SISTERS AND FRIENDS AND RELATIONS AND HOUSE AND HOME AND MANY COMFORTS OF THIS LIFE BUT NOW WE MAY SAY AS JOB
4406-16883-0014 AND BEAR TOGETHER AND INVITED MY MASTER AND MISTRESS TO DINNER BUT THE PROUD GOSSIP BECAUSE I SERVED THEM BOTH IN ONE DISH WOULD EAT NOTHING EXCEPT ONE BIT THAT HE GAVE HER UPON THE POINT OF HIS KNIFE
4406-16883-0021 BUT HE LIVING BY THE RIVERSIDE WHERE I OFTEN WENT TO FETCH WATER I WOULD OFTEN BE PUTTING OF HIM IN MIND AND CALLING FOR MY PAY AT LAST HE TOLD ME IF I WOULD MAKE ANOTHER SHIRT FOR A PAPOOSE NOT YET BORN HE WOULD GIVE ME A KNIFE WHICH HE DID WHEN I HAD DONE IT
4406-16883-0028 FOR FEAR THEY WOULD GET IT FROM ME AND THERE IT LAY ALL THAT DAY AND NIGHT IN MY STINKING POCKET
4406-16883-0042 BUT I HAD NO OTHER COMFORTING ANSWER FROM THEM THAN THIS THAT IT WOULD BE NO MATTER IF MY HEAD WERE OFF TOO THE THIRTEENTH REMOVE INSTEAD OF GOING TOWARD THE BAY WHICH WAS THAT I DESIRED
4406-16883-0049 BUT WHEN I WAS WITHOUT AND SAW NOTHING BUT WILDERNESS AND WOODS AND A COMPANY OF BARBAROUS HEATHENS MY MIND QUICKLY RETURNED TO ME WHICH MADE ME THINK OF THAT SPOKEN CONCERNING SAMPSON WHO SAID I WILL GO OUT AND SHAKE MYSELF AS AT OTHER TIMES
4406-16883-0056 AND THAT ALL PERSUADED I WAS DEAD SO LIKE WERE THESE BARBAROUS CREATURES TO HIM WHO WAS A LIAR FROM THE BEGINNING AS I WAS SITTING ONCE IN THE WIGWAM HERE PHILIP'S MAID CAME IN WITH THE CHILD IN HER ARMS
441-128982-0009 AND THE ATHLETIC BUCCANEER THOUGHT THAT HE COULD EASILY GET THE BETTER OF WHOEVER MIGHT OPEN THE HATCH BUT THE NEXT ACT IN THIS TRULY MELODRAMATIC PERFORMANCE WOULD BE A GREAT DEAL MORE DIFFICULT FOR IN ORDER TO ESCAPE FROM THE SHIP IT WOULD BE ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY FOR BARTHOLEMY TO SWIM TO SHORE
441-128982-0016 AND RAN AS FAST AS HE COULD INTO THE DARK WOODS BEYOND THE TOWN BARTHOLEMY WAS NOW GREATLY IN FEAR THAT WHEN HIS ESCAPE WAS DISCOVERED HE WOULD BE TRACKED BY BLOODHOUNDS
441-128982-0023 WHEN HE HAD MADE FOR HIMSELF WHAT SEEMED TO BE A FREE PASSAGE HE WOULD DASH IN AND HURRY ACROSS AT OTHER TIMES GREAT FORESTS STRETCHED DOWN TO THE VERY COAST AND THROUGH THESE HE WAS OBLIGED TO MAKE HIS WAY
441-128988-0000 CHAPTER THIRTEEN A RESURRECTED PIRATE
441-128988-0007 INFORMING THE GOVERNOR OF THE ISLAND THAT THE CRUEL PIRATE L'OLONNOIS WAS IN A SHIP A SHORT DISTANCE FROM THEIR VILLAGE WHICH HE UNDOUBTEDLY INTENDED TO ATTACK WHEN THE GOVERNOR HEARD THIS ASTONISHING TALE
441-128988-0014 BUT NO INTENTION OF GIVING UP HIS PROJECT ENTERED HIS MIND AS THE SPANISH VESSEL WAS IN HIS WAY HE WOULD ATTACK HER AND GET HER OUT OF HIS WAY IF THE THING COULD BE DONE IN THIS NEW STATE OF AFFAIRS HE WAS OBLIGED TO USE STRATAGEM
441-128988-0028 AND THERE HE COMPOSED A LETTER TO THE GOVERNOR OF HAVANA A PART OF WHICH READ AS FOLLOWS I SHALL NEVER HENCEFORWARD GIVE QUARTER UNTO ANY SPANIARD WHATSOEVER
441-128988-0035 AND HE ALSO DISCOVERED MUCH TO HIS SURPRISE THAT THERE WERE VERY FEW PROVISIONS ON BOARD FOR WHEN THE VESSEL WAS SENT FROM HAVANA IT WAS SUPPOSED SHE WOULD MAKE BUT A VERY SHORT CRUISE
441-130108-0006 LIKE BIRDS BUT THEY WERE NOW FOR THE MOST PART BLACK CREATURES WHO FLAPPED THEIR WINGS DREARILY NEAR TO THE GROUND AND REFUSED TO RISE ON ANY WINGS OF HOPE THE MEN'S FACES GREW DOLEFUL FROM THE INTERPRETING OF OMENS
441-130108-0020 I DON'T THINK I FOUGHT THE WHOLE BATTLE YESTERDAY BUT THE OTHER SEEMED INNOCENT OF ANY DEEPER MEANING APPARENTLY HE HAD NO INFORMATION IT WAS MERELY HIS HABIT OH HE REPLIED IN THE SAME TONE OF CALM DERISION
441-130108-0027 SAID A MAN HERE WE ARE EVERYBODY FIGHTIN BLOOD AN DESTRUCTION
441-130108-0034 AT THIS TIME THERE WAS AN INTERPOSITION BY THE SAVAGE MINDED LIEUTENANT WHO WAS OBLIGED TO VENT SOME OF HIS INWARD DISSATISFACTION UPON HIS MEN YOU BOYS SHUT RIGHT UP

445-123860-0023 EXTREME A BLISS IN PROOF
446-123501-0003 THE IRREGULARITIES OF LOW HILLS IT WAS MIDDAY THE SUN WAS SHINING FULL UPON ME AND THE HEAT OF IT WAS RATHER INTENSE UPON MY NAKED BODY YET NO GREATER
446-123501-0017 THEIR NOSES WERE BUT LONGITUDINAL SLITS IN THE CENTER OF THEIR FACES MIDWAY BETWEEN THEIR MOUTHS AND EARS THERE WAS NO HAIR ON THEIR BODIES
446-123501-0024 OF THE LITTLE DEVILS I HAD BEEN WATCHING BUT HOW PUNY AND HARMLESS THEY NOW LOOKED BESIDE THIS HUGE AND TERRIFIC INCARNATION OF HATE OF VENGEANCE AND OF DEATH
446-123501-0031 WHICH FACT HAD ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO THE NOISELESSNESS OF THEIR APPROACH AND IN COMMON WITH A MULTIPLICITY OF LEGS IS A CHARACTERISTIC FEATURE OF THE FAUNA OF MARS THE HIGHEST TYPE OF MAN
446-123501-0045 THEY ARE DEADLY IN THE EXTREME
446-123501-0052 HE THEN STOPPED AS THOUGH WAITING FOR MY REPLY PRICKING UP HIS ANTENNAE LIKE EARS AND COCKING HIS STRANGE LOOKING EYES STILL FURTHER TOWARD ME AS THE SILENCE BECAME PAINFUL
446-123501-0059 EVIDENTLY HE FEARED THAT WERE I TO BE REALLY FRIGHTENED AGAIN I MIGHT JUMP ENTIRELY OUT OF THE LANDSCAPE HE EXCHANGED A FEW WORDS WITH HIS MEN MOTIONED TO ME THAT I WOULD RIDE BEHIND ONE OF THEM AND THEN MOUNTED HIS OWN ANIMAL
446-123502-0011 THE AVERAGE LIFE EXPECTANCY OF A MARTIAN AFTER THE AGE OF MATURITY IS ABOUT THREE HUNDRED YEARS BUT WOULD BE NEARER THE ONE THOUSAND MARK WERE IT NOT FOR THE VARIOUS MEANS LEADING TO VIOLENT DEATH
446-123502-0018 WHICH WAS DOTTED WITH HIGHLY CARVED WOODEN DESKS AND CHAIRS WERE ASSEMBLED ABOUT FORTY OR FIFTY MALE MARTIANS AROUND THE STEPS OF A ROSTRUM ON THE PLATFORM PROPER
446-123502-0025 AT THE TIME THIS CEREMONY AND THE WORDS THEY UTTERED MEANT NOTHING TO ME BUT LATER I CAME TO KNOW THAT THIS WAS THE CUSTOMARY GREETING BETWEEN GREEN MARTIANS HAD THE MEN BEEN STRANGERS AND THEREFORE UNABLE TO EXCHANGE NAMES
446-123502-0039 I SAW WHAT THEY WERE AFTER AND GATHERING MYSELF TOGETHER I SAKKED WITH SUCH MARVELOUS SUCCESS THAT I CLEARED A GOOD HUNDRED AND FIFTY FEET NOR DID I THIS TIME LOSE MY EQUILIBRIUM BUT LANDED SQUARELY UPON MY FEET
446-123502-0046 IN ONE OF THE BUILDINGS FRONTING ON THE PLAZA AND WHICH FROM THE LITTER OF SILKS AND FURS UPON THE FLOOR I TOOK TO BE THE SLEEPING QUARTERS OF SEVERAL OF THE NATIVES THE ROOM WAS WELL LIGHTED BY A NUMBER OF LARGE WINDOWS

4481-17498-0024 AND THEN CARRY IT OUT IN SPITE OF ALL OPPOSITION BUT TO TAKE PATSY TO EUROPE WOULD BE LIKE PULLING THE MAJOR'S EYE TEETH OR AMPUTATING HIS GOOD RIGHT ARM WORSE FAR WORSE IT WOULD MEAN TAKING THE SUNSHINE OUT OF HER OLD FATHER'S SKY ALTOGETHER
4481-17498-0031 YOU'VE NO WORRY AT ALL WHY WE'VE JUST MADE YOU A QUARTER OF A MILLION IN C H AND D'S THE WE IS EXPLAINED BY STATING THAT THE MAJOR HELD AN IMPORTANT POSITION IN THE GREAT BANKING HOUSE A POSITION MISTER MERRICK HAD SECURED FOR HIM SOME MONTHS PREVIOUSLY

458-126305-0000 THE LITTLE PEASANT THERE WAS A CERTAIN VILLAGE WHEREIN NO ONE LIVED BUT REALLY RICH PEASANTS AND JUST ONE POOR ONE WHOM THEY CALLED THE LITTLE PEASANT HE HAD NOT EVEN SO MUCH AS A COW AND STILL LESS MONEY TO BUY ONE

460-172359-0014 THEY SAID COMMONLY IN MARIPOSA THAT JEFF MADE MONEY OUT OF THE BARBER SHOP HE MAY HAVE AND IT MAY HAVE BEEN THAT THAT TURNED HIS MIND TO INVESTMENT BUT IT'S HARD TO SEE HOW HE COULD A SHAVE COST FIVE CENTS AND A HAIR CUT FIFTEEN OR THE TWO IF YOU LIKED FOR A QUARTER
460-172359-0021 THEY READ THE WHOLE THING FROM COVER TO COVER AND THEY BUILD UP ON IT IN THE COURSE OF YEARS A RANGE OF ACQUIREMENT THAT WOULD PUT A COLLEGE PRESIDENT TO THE BLUSH

4640-19189-0026 OH THE HUMAN RACE WILL BE DELIVERED RAISED UP CONSOLED WE AFFIRM IT ON THIS BARRIER WHENCE SHOULD PROCEED THAT CRY OF LOVE IF NOT FROM THE HEIGHTS OF SACRIFICE
4640-19189-0033 MARIUS LET US INSIST ON THIS POINT WAS UNDER THE SHADOW OF THE GREAT DARK WINGS WHICH ARE SPREAD OVER THOSE IN THE DEATH AGONY HE FELT THAT HE HAD ENTERED THE TOMB
4680-16026-0002 SO EPONINE FOLLOWED HIM WITHOUT HIS SUSPECTING THE FACT SHE SAW HIM DISPLACE THE BAR AND SLIP INTO THE GARDEN
4680-16026-0009 THE FIRST TO ARRIVE AT THE GARDEN RAILING HALTED AND WAITED FOR THE OTHERS
4680-16026-0016 THERE'S NOTHING TO BE DONE HERE BUT EMBRACE ME MY GOOD LITTLE FATHER IT'S A LONG TIME SINCE I'VE SEEN YOU SO YOU'RE OUT THENARDIER TRIED TO DISENTANGLE HIMSELF FROM EPONINE'S ARMS AND GRUMBLED THAT'S GOOD
4680-16026-0030 WHAT DO I CARE IF I'M PICKED UP TO MORROW MORNING ON THE PAVEMENT OF THE RUE PLUMET KILLED BY THE BLOWS OF MY FATHER'S CLUB
4680-16026-0037 THENARDIER SAID NOT A WORD AND SEEMED READY FOR WHATEVER THE REST PLEASED BRUJON WHO WAS SOMEWHAT OF AN ORACLE AND WHO HAD AS THE READER KNOWS PUT UP THE JOB HAD NOT AS YET SPOKEN HE SEEMED THOUGHTFUL
4680-16041-0003 BY THE BOULEVARD TRAVERSED THE ESPLANADE AND THE BRIDGE OF THE INVALIDES
4680-16041-0017 IT HAD PASSED AND VANISHED PROCEEDING FROM CIRCUIT TO CIRCUIT HE REACHED A LANE WHICH HE JUDGED TO BE THE RUE DE LA POTERIE NEAR THE MIDDLE OF THIS STREET
4680-16041-0024 THE INVISIBLE POLICE OF THE INSURRECTION WERE ON THE WATCH EVERYWHERE AND MAINTAINED ORDER THAT IS TO SAY NIGHT THE NECESSARY TACTICS OF INSURRECTION ARE TO DROWN SMALL NUMBERS IN A VAST OBSCURITY
4680-16041-0031 AND AS WE HAVE JUST SEEN ANY STREET WHICH ONE MIGHT COME TO OFFERED NOTHING BUT DARKNESS A WILD DARKNESS FULL OF TRAPS FULL OF UNSEEN AND FORMIDABLE SHOCKS INTO WHICH IT WAS ALARMING TO PENETRATE
4680-16042-0003 ALL THIS WAS TEN FATHOMS DISTANT FROM HIM IT WAS THE INTERIOR OF THE BARRICADE THE HOUSES WHICH BORDERED THE LANE ON THE RIGHT CONCEALED THE REST OF THE WINE SHOP THE LARGE BARRICADE AND THE FLAG FROM HIM
4680-16042-0010 AND TO DEPART IN WRATH INTO THE GLOOM THAT IF IT HAD THUS FLED IT WAS BECAUSE IT WAS INTELLIGENT AND BECAUSE IT HAD FORESEEN THE FUTURE THAT IT HAD HAD A PRESENTIMENT OF THIS REBELLION THE WAR OF THE GUTTERS
4680-16042-0017 WHO WERE A MERE HANDFUL AGAINST AN ARMY SHOULD HE BE UNTRUE AT ONCE TO HIS LOVE TO COUNTRY TO HIS WORD SHOULD HE GIVE TO HIS COWARDICE THE PRETEXT OF PATRIOTISM BUT THIS WAS IMPOSSIBLE AND IF THE PHANTOM OF HIS FATHER WAS THERE IN THE GLOOM
4680-16042-0031 ARE WHAT HISTORY IS IN THE HABIT OF CALLING GOOD KINGS BUT PRINCIPLES ARE NOT TO BE PARCELLED OUT THE LOGIC OF THE TRUE IS RECTILINEAR THE PECULIARITY OF TRUTH IS THAT IT LACKS COMPLAISANCE NO CONCESSIONS THEN
4680-16042-0038 THIS WAS THE PORTER WHO HAD BEEN KILLED BY LE CABUC BELOW BY THE LIGHTS OF THE TORCH WHICH WAS THRUST BETWEEN THE PAVING STONES THIS HEAD COULD BE VAGUELY DISTINGUISHED NOTHING COULD BE STRANGER IN THAT SOMBRE AND UNCERTAIN GLEAM
4788-294466-0005 FEELING ASSURED THAT THE GIRLS WERE ALL RIGHT THE BOYS WENT AT A GALLOP DOWN THE ROAD AND ACROSS THE DESERT VALLEY TO THE NEWCOMB RANCH
4788-294466-0019 GRAY BEARDED UNKEMPT BUT WITH KIND GRAY EYES DEEP SUNKEN UNDER SHAGGY BROWS STOOD IN THE OPEN DOOR HE SMILED OUT AT THEM IN A FRIENDLY WAY THEN BECKONED WITH A BONY FINGER
4788-294466-0026 YOU WAIT UNTIL DICK HAS BEEN ON THE DESERT LONG ENOUGH TO GET A COAT OF TAN HE MAY SURPRISE YOU
4788-91208-0001 THE POINTSMAN MOVES A HANDLE AND THE FOAMING GIANT THAT WOULD IT MAY BE HAVE SPED ON TO HIS DESTRUCTION AND THAT OF THE PASSIVE CREW WHO FOLLOW IN HIS REAR IS SHUNTED TO ANOTHER LINE RUNNING IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION AND TO A MORE DESIRABLE GOAL
4788-91208-0015 THE MORTALITY OF JOHN THOMAS AND OTHERS IS AFTER ALL THE WHOLE EVIDENCE WE HAVE FOR THE MORTALITY OF THE DUKE OF WELLINGTON NOT ONE IOTA IS ADDED TO THE PROOF BY INTERPOLATING A GENERAL PROPOSITION
4788-91208-0022 THE BIGGEST LION IN THE PATH WAS THE DOCTRINE OF SO CALLED NECESSARY TRUTH THIS DOCTRINE WAS ESPECIALLY OBNOXIOUS TO HIM AS IT SET UP A PURELY SUBJECTIVE STANDARD OF TRUTH AND A STANDARD AS HE WAS EASILY ABLE TO SHOW
4788-91208-0029 AND REGARDED AS THE REDUCTIO AD ABSURDISSIMUM OF THE TRANSCENDENTAL PHILOSOPHY MISTER MILL'S RELIGIOUS TENDENCIES MAY VERY WELL BE GATHERED FROM A PASSAGE IN HIS REVIEW OF AUGUSTE COMTE A PHILOSOPHER WITH WHOM HE AGREED ON ALL POINTS
4788-94904-0007 WHETHER MONARCHICAL OR POPULAR IN ANY CASE IN WHICH THE ATTEMPT TO INTRODUCE REPRESENTATIVE GOVERNMENT IS AT ALL LIKELY TO BE MADE INDIFFERENCE TO IT
4788-94904-0021 WHICH EXISTS IN THAT COUNTRY THIS BENEFIT HOWEVER IS ENTIRELY DEPENDENT ON THE COEXISTENCE WITH THE POPULAR BODY OF AN HEREDITARY KING IF INSTEAD OF STRUGGLING FOR THE FAVORS OF THE CHIEF RULER THESE SELFISH AND SORDID FACTIONS STRUGGLED FOR THE CHIEF PLACE ITSELF
4788-94904-0035 THEN ANOTHER OF THE IMMEDIATE OPPRESSORS HIS PROGRESS TO ASCENDANCY WAS SLOW BUT IT RESULTED FROM SUCCESSIVELY TAKING ADVANTAGE OF OPPORTUNITIES WHICH OFFERED THEMSELVES ONLY TO HIM IT WAS THEREFORE SURE AND IN PROPORTION AS IT WAS ACCOMPLISHED
481-123719-0002 I WAS A TERRIBLE DREAMER I WOULD DREAM FOR THREE MONTHS ON END TUCKED AWAY IN MY CORNER AND YOU MAY BELIEVE ME THAT AT THOSE MOMENTS I HAD NO RESEMBLANCE TO THE GENTLEMAN WHO IN THE PERTURBATION OF HIS CHICKEN HEART
481-123719-0009 AND FOR THAT VERY REASON I QUITE CONTENTEDLY OCCUPIED THE LOWEST IN REALITY EITHER TO BE A HERO OR TO GROVEL IN THE MUD THERE WAS NOTHING BETWEEN
481-123719-0023 BUT WHY IS IT CONTEMPTIBLE CAN YOU IMAGINE THAT I AM ASHAMED OF IT ALL AND THAT IT WAS STUPIDER THAN ANYTHING IN YOUR LIFE GENTLEMEN AND I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT SOME OF THESE FANCIES WERE BY NO MEANS BADLY COMPOSED
481-123719-0030 ONE SMALLER THAN THE OTHER OF A PARTICULARLY FRUGAL AND SALLOW APPEARANCE HE HAD TWO DAUGHTERS AND THEIR AUNT WHO USED TO POUR OUT THE TEA OF THE DAUGHTERS ONE WAS THIRTEEN AND ANOTHER FOURTEEN
481-123719-0037 CURSES ON THAT SCHOOL AND ALL THOSE TERRIBLE YEARS OF PENAL SERVITUDE IN SHORT I PARTED FROM MY SCHOOLFELLOWS AS SOON AS I GOT OUT INTO THE WORLD THERE WERE TWO OR THREE LEFT TO WHOM I NODDED IN THE STREET ONE OF THEM WAS SIMONOV
481-123720-0009 I HATED THE ABRUPT SELF CONFIDENT TONE OF HIS VOICE HIS ADMIRATION OF HIS OWN WITTICISMS
481-123720-0016 THE LAUGH WAS ON HIS SIDE HE GOT THE BETTER OF ME ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS AFTERWARDS BUT WITHOUT MALICE JESTINGLY CASUALLY I REMAINED ANGRILY AND CONTEMPTUOUSLY SILENT AND WOULD NOT ANSWER HIM WHEN WE LEFT SCHOOL HE MADE ADVANCES TO ME
481-123720-0023 OF PERSONAL HONOUR THOUGH OF COURSE HE WAS A WRETCHED LITTLE COWARD AT HEART HE WAS ONE OF THOSE WORSHIPPERS OF ZVERKOV WHO MADE UP TO THE LATTER FROM INTERESTED MOTIVES AND OFTEN BORROWED MONEY FROM HIM SIMONOV'S OTHER VISITOR TRUDOLYUBOV WAS A PERSON IN NO WAY REMARKABLE
481-123720-0037 TRUDOLYUBOV BARELY NODDED SIMONOV WITH WHOM I WAS LEFT TETE A TETE WAS IN A STATE OF VEXATION AND PERPLEXITY AND LOOKED AT ME QUEERLY
481-123720-0044 IT'S CLOSE BY NOT TWO PACES AWAY SIMONOV REPEATED ACCOMPANYING ME TO THE FRONT DOOR WITH A FUSSY AIR WHICH DID NOT SUIT HIM AT ALL
481-123720-0051 AND LOOKING WITH SAVAGE DISTRUST AT EVERYONE MY SCHOOLFELLOWS MET ME WITH SPITEFUL AND MERCILESS JIBES BECAUSE I WAS NOT LIKE ANY OF THEM BUT I COULD NOT ENDURE THEIR TAUNTS
481-123720-0065 AND REPULSED HIM AS THOUGH ALL I NEEDED HIM FOR WAS TO WIN A VICTORY OVER HIM TO SUBJUGATE HIM AND NOTHING ELSE BUT I COULD NOT SUBJUGATE ALL OF THEM MY FRIEND WAS NOT AT ALL LIKE THEM EITHER HE WAS IN FACT A RARE EXCEPTION
481-123720-0072 I HAD LET MYSELF GET TOO SLOVENLY MY UNIFORM PERHAPS WAS TIDY BUT I COULD NOT GO OUT TO DINNER IN MY UNIFORM THE WORST OF IT WAS THAT ON THE KNEE OF MY TROUSERS WAS A BIG YELLOW STAIN
481-123720-0079 ON THE CONTRARY I PASSIONATELY LONGED TO SHOW ALL THAT RABBLE THAT I WAS BY NO MEANS SUCH A SPIRITLESS CREATURE AS I SEEMED TO MYSELF WHAT IS MORE EVEN IN THE ACUTEST PAROXYSM OF THIS COWARDLY FEVER I DREAMED OF GETTING THE UPPER HAND
4813-248638-0007 AND ALTHOUGH SO LEVELED BY THE PROCESS OF THE AGES THEY ARE STILL THE HIGHEST LAND NEAR THE COAST FROM MAINE TO MEXICO THESE EIGHTEEN OR TWENTY SKYEY CRESTS FORM THE SOUTHERN BOUNDARY OF THE SO CALLED BOSTON BASIN

4813-248641-0034 THE LAST OCCUPANT WAS A BLACK LUCRETIA WHO AFTER BEING FREED WAS INVITED TO SIT DOWNSTAIRS WITH HER MASTER AND MISTRESS WHICH SHE DID AND WHICH SHE CONTINUED TO DO UNTIL HER DEATH NOT SO VERY LONG AGO
4813-248641-0041 AND WALL PAPER A HUNDRED YEARS OLD HINGHAM'S FAMOUS ELMS SHADE THE HOUSE WHERE PARSON EBENEZER GAY LIVED OUT HIS LONG PASTORATE OF SIXTY NINE YEARS AND NINE MONTHS AND THE GARRISON HOUSE BUILT BEFORE SIXTEEN FORTY

4830-25898-0007 WHICH ENDED IN CHANTY'S UTTER DEFEAT FOR HE DIED FROM HIS WOUNDS DOWNY AND SNOWBALL SOON FOLLOWED FOR THE TWO SWEET LITTLE THINGS WOULD SWING ON THE BURDOCK LEAVES THAT GREW OVER THE BROOK
4830-25898-0014 AND UNCONSCIOUS OF THE DANGER STOOD HER GROUND AS A GREAT HAWK CAME CIRCLING NEARER AND NEARER TILL WITH A SUDDEN DART HE POUNCED ON THE POOR CHICKEN AND BORE IT AWAY CHIRPING DISMALLY
4830-25898-0021 AND HEAR IF I CAN'T DO IT AS WELL AS DADDY THE CHICKS STOPPED SCRATCHING AND PEEPING AND SAT IN A ROW TO HEAR STRUT CROW PERCHING HIMSELF ON THE BEAM HE TRIED HIS BEST

4830-25904-0007 WHEN FED THEY GOBBLED UP THE FISH NEVER STOPPING TO SWALLOW IT TILL THE POUCHES UNDER THEIR BILLS WERE FULL THEN THEY LEISURELY EMPTIED THEM AND SEEMED TO ENJOY THEIR LUNCH WITH THE GRAVE DELIBERATION OF REGULAR ENGLISHMEN
4830-25904-0014 AND ALL TO GET VERY MUCH EXCITED ABOUT SOMETHING SNIFFING AT THE OPENINGS THRUSTING THEIR PAWS THROUGH THE BARS AND LASHING THEIR TAILS IMPATIENTLY I COULDN'T IMAGINE WHAT THE TROUBLE WAS TILL
4830-25904-0021 ONE LITTLE LEOPARD WAS BETTER BRED THAN THE OTHERS FOR HE WENT UP ON A SHELF IN THE CAGE AND ATE HIS DINNER IN A QUIET PROPER MANNER WHICH WAS AN EXAMPLE TO THE REST THE LIONS ATE IN DIGNIFIED SILENCE
4830-25904-0035 BEST WHEN I CAME TO HIS CAGE I DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING BUT THE BRANCH OF A TREE SUCH AS I HAD SEEN IN OTHER CAGES FOR THE SNAKES TO WIND UP AND DOWN WHERE IS HE I WONDER I HOPE HE HASN'T GOT
4830-25904-0042 MUCH TO THE AMUSEMENT OF SOME CHILDREN RIDING ON THE ELEPHANT WHOSE TRUNK HAD FRIGHTENED ME HE HAD POLITELY TRIED TO TELL ME TO CLEAR THE WAY WHICH I CERTAINLY HAD DONE WITH ALL SPEED PICKING MYSELF OUT OF THE HEDGE
4830-25904-0049 THE GREAT POLAR BEAR LIVED NEXT DOOR AND SPENT HIS TIME SPLASHING IN AND OUT OF A POOL OF WATER OR SITTING ON A BLOCK OF ICE PANTING AS IF THE MILD SPRING DAY WAS BLAZING MIDSUMMER
4853-27670-0012 EVEN ONE ONLY TO MAKE ME AN ECHO FOR MINE OWN SPEECH NAY GOD HIMSELF THE MERCIFUL FATHER OF ALL EVEN HE SEEMED NOT THE BLACKNESS LAY LIKE A PALL UPON THE DEEP AND UPON MY SOUL
4853-27670-0019 I SWALLOWED HALF A PANNIKIN OF THE HOLLANDS FOR THE SAKE OF THE WARMTH AND LIFE OF THE DRAUGHT AND ENTERING MY CABIN PUT ON THICK DRY STOCKINGS FIRST CHAFING MY FEET TILL I FELT THE BLOOD IN THEM
4853-27670-0026 AND AS IF THAT HAD NOT SUFFICED TO SLAY HIM THE FALL OF THE MASTS HAD IN SOME WONDERFUL MANNER WHIPPED A ROPE SEVERAL TIMES ROUND HIS BODY BINDING HIS ARMS AND ENCIRCLING HIS THROAT SO TIGHTLY
4853-27671-0003 YET FOR A FEW MOMENTS I STOOD CONTEMPLATING THE SCENE OF RUIN IT WAS VISIBLE NOW TO ITS MOST TRIFLING DETAIL THE FOREMAST WAS GONE SMOOTH OFF AT THE DECK IT LAY OVER THE STARBOARD BOW
4853-27671-0010 I RAN TO THE CABIN BUT THE LAZARETTE WAS FULL OF WATER AND NONE OF THE PROVISIONS IN IT TO BE COME AT I THEREUPON RANSACKED THE CABIN AND FOUND A WHOLE DUTCH CHEESE A PIECE OF RAW PORK HALF A HAM
4853-27671-0017 SHOT WITH PEARLY LUSTRE FLOATED OVERHEAD VERY HIGH IT WAS IN TRUTH A FAIR AND PLEASANT MORNING OF AN ICY COLDNESS INDEED BUT THE AIR BEING DRY ITS SHREWDNESS WAS ENDURABLE
4853-27671-0030 I UNDERSTOOD THAT MY ONLY HOPE OF DELIVERANCE LAY IN BEING PICKED UP AND THAT THOUGH BY HEADING EAST I SHOULD BE CLINGING TO THE STORMY PARTS I WAS MORE LIKELY TO MEET WITH A SHIP HEREABOUTS
4853-29413-0003 THE DELAY OF DRESSING WAS MORE THAN I HAD PATIENCE TO ENCOUNTER UNLESS I WAS COMPLETELY MISTAKEN HERE WAS THE VERY PERSON WHOM I WANTED TO ENLIGHTEN ME GLOODY SHOWED HIMSELF AT THE DOOR
4853-29413-0017 A LAPSE OF A QUARTER OF AN HOUR FOLLOWED THE LAST DOSE WAS REPEATED AND THE DOG SOON SPRANG TO HIS FEET AGAIN AS LIVELY AS EVER GLOODY WAS THEREUPON TOLD TO SET THE ANIMAL FREE AND WAS INFORMED AT THE SAME TIME
4853-29413-0024 HOW DID YOU KNOW THAT HE WOULD NOT DRINK THE WHOLE CONTENTS OF THE JUG YOU FORGET SIR THAT I HAD SEEN THE DOG REVIVED BY TWO DOSES GIVEN WITH A SPACE OF TIME BETWEEN THEM
4853-29413-0031 HAD WE ANY PROOF TO JUSTIFY US GLOODY AT ONCE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT WE HAD NO PROOF I HAPPENED TO LOOK AT THE BOAT HE SAID AND I MISSED THE OARS OH YES I SEARCHED THE BOAT HOUSE NO OARS NO OARS
4859-22176-0012 GLANCING AT THE LADY IN THE BLACK DRESS THE PRINCESS ROSE QUICKLY TO MEET HIM AND HELD OUT HER HAND YES SHE SAID LOOKING AT HIS ALTERED FACE AFTER HE HAD KISSED HER HAND SO THIS IS HOW WE MEET AGAIN
4859-22176-0019 AND OF WHICH HE HAD NOT EVEN BEEN THINKING ESPECIALLY AT THAT MOMENT IT SUFFUSED HIM SEIZED HIM AND ENVELOPED HIM COMPLETELY WHEN SHE SMILED DOUBT WAS NO LONGER POSSIBLE IT WAS NATASHA AND HE LOVED HER
4859-26870-0001 A MAN WHO HAD SUCCEEDED TO THE POST WHEN DRON DIED AND WHO WAS ACCUSED OF DISHONESTY AND VARIOUS IRREGULARITIES NICHOLAS WENT OUT INTO THE PORCH TO QUESTION HIM AND IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE ELDER HAD GIVEN A FEW REPLIES THE SOUND OF CRIES AND BLOWS WERE HEARD
4859-26870-0015 IN WINTER EXCEPT FOR BUSINESS EXCURSIONS HE SPENT MOST OF HIS TIME AT HOME MAKING HIMSELF ONE WITH HIS FAMILY AND ENTERING INTO ALL THE DETAILS OF HIS CHILDREN'S RELATIONS WITH THEIR MOTHER THE HARMONY BETWEEN HIM AND HIS WIFE GREW CLOSER AND CLOSER
4859-26870-0022 AND HAD GROWN QUITE RECONCILED TO HER LOT AS A STERILE FLOWER SHE SEEMED TO BE FOND NOT SO MUCH OF INDIVIDUALS AS OF THE FAMILY AS A WHOLE LIKE A CAT SHE HAD ATTACHED HERSELF NOT TO THE PEOPLE BUT TO THE HOME
4859-29340-0003 ONE HISTORIAN SAYS THAT AN EVENT WAS PRODUCED BY NAPOLEON'S POWER ANOTHER THAT IT WAS PRODUCED BY ALEXANDER'S
4859-29340-0017 TRIES TO PROVE THAT THE CAMPAIGN OF EIGHTEEN THIRTEEN AND THE RESTORATION OF THE BOURBONS WERE DUE TO OTHER THINGS BESIDE ALEXANDER'S WILL SUCH AS THE ACTIVITY OF STEIN METTERNICH MADAME DE STAEL TALLEYRAND
4859-29340-0024 AND IN THE SAME WAY THE UNIVERSAL HISTORIANS SOMETIMES WHEN IT PLEASES THEM AND FITS IN WITH THEIR THEORY SAY THAT POWER IS THE RESULT OF EVENTS AND SOMETIMES WHEN THEY WANT TO PROVE SOMETHING ELSE SAY THAT POWER PRODUCES EVENTS
4859-29340-0031 AND TO THE FORMER POWER OF MONARCHS AND TO THE INFLUENCE OF ADVISERS AND OTHER PEOPLE INTRODUCED BY THE UNIVERSAL HISTORIANS ANOTHER NEWER FORCE THE IDEA IS ADDED THE CONNECTION OF WHICH WITH THE MASSES NEEDS EXPLANATION
4898-20016-0003 WHICH NATHAN ATTENDS STANDS IN THE SAME SQUARE WITH HIS SHOP AND NEARLY OPPOSITE IT WAS CLOSED AS USUAL ON CHRISTMAS DAY AND A RECENT SNOW HAD HEAPED THE STEPS AND ROOF AND LOADED THE WINDOWS
4898-20016-0010 AND LOOKED INTO THE CHURCH THROUGH A LITTLE WINDOW AT ONE SIDE OF THE PULPIT FOR THIS HE STARTED BUT HE DID NOT FAIL TO RUN ACROSS THE SQUARE AND LEAP OVER THE CHURCH GATE AT THE TOP OF HIS SPEED
4898-20016-0017 THE MORE HE WAS FILLED FOR ALL THEIR APPEARANCE OF YOUTH AND THEIR SIMPLE MANNERS WITH A STRANGE SORT OF VENERATION THE SWEET AND CHEERFUL FACES OF THE YOUNG WOMEN SEEMED TO GROW AWFULLY CALM
4898-20016-0031 AND CROWDED WITH PEOPLE WHOM HIS EYE VERSED IN THE DRESS AND MANNERS OF OUR FOREFATHERS RECOGNIZED AS THE CHURCH GOERS OF A CENTURY AND A HALF AGO THE SINGERS GALLERY WAS FILLED BY A CHOIR OF GIRLS AND BOYS
4898-20016-0038 HAD BEEN LEFT AT HIS DOOR BY A WHITE HAIRED OLD MAN DRESSED IN BLACK ABOUT SIX IN THE MORNING JUST AFTER HE HAD GONE TO VISIT HIS SICK PARISHIONER THE GIRL WHO RECEIVED IT REPORTED THE OLD MAN AS SAYING
4898-28461-0004 ARE STILL OCCUPIED BY GLACIERS WHICH DESCEND IN SHOWY RANKS THEIR MESSY BULGING SNOUTS LYING BACK A LITTLE DISTANCE IN THE SHADOWS OF THE WALLS OR PUSHING FORWARD AMONG THE COTTON WOODS
4898-28461-0018 THE RICH HAZY SUNSHINE STREAMING OVER THE CLIFFS CALLS FORTH THE LAST OF THE GENTIANS AND GOLDENRODS THE GROVES AND THICKETS AND MEADOWS BLOOM AGAIN AS THEIR LEAVES CHANGE TO RED AND YELLOW PETALS
4898-28461-0025 CIRQUES AND BRANCH CANYONS ALONG THE TOPS AND SIDES OF THE WALLS THE INDIANS HAVE A TRADITION THAT THE RIVER USED TO RUN THROUGH A TUNNEL UNDER THE UNITED FRONTS OF THE TWO LARGE TRIBUTARY GLACIERS MENTIONED ABOVE
4898-28461-0032 ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE RIVER THERE IS A GROUP OF FIVE GLACIERS ONE OF THEM DESCENDING TO WITHIN A HUNDRED FEET OF THE RIVER NEAR GLENORA ON THE NORTHEASTERN FLANK OF THE MAIN COAST RANGE
4898-28461-0045 I THOUGHT THAT BY RAPID CLIMBING I COULD REACH THE SUMMIT BEFORE SUNSET IN TIME TO GET A GENERAL VIEW AND A FEW PENCIL SKETCHES AND MAKE MY WAY BACK TO THE STEAMER IN THE NIGHT MISTER YOUNG ONE OF THE MISSIONARIES ASKED PERMISSION TO ACCOMPANY ME
4898-28461-0052 TO MAKE SURE THAT IT WAS NOT INTERRUPTED BY SHEER PRECIPICES I CONCLUDED THAT WITH GREAT CARE AND THE DIGGING OF SLIGHT FOOTHOLDS HE COULD BE SLID DOWN TO THE GLACIER WHERE I COULD LAY HIM ON HIS BACK AND PERHAPS BE ABLE TO SET HIS ARMS
4898-28461-0059 A DISTANCE OF PERHAPS A MILE CROSSED THE MORAINE BATHED HIS HEAD AT ONE OF THE OUTLET STREAMS AND AFTER MANY RESTS REACHED A DRY PLACE AND MADE A BRUSH FIRE I THEN WENT AHEAD LOOKING FOR AN OPEN WAY
5022-29405-0004 ALMOST MADE ME REGRET THAT HE HAD NOT DIED OF THE ILLNESS WHICH HAD STRUCK HIM DEAF
5022-29405-0011 OF COURSE THAT BOLD GIRL CONTRIVED TO ATTRACT YOUR NOTICE I REPLIED THAT I HAD MET WITH THE BOLD GIRL PURELY BY ACCIDENT ON HER SIDE AS WELL AS ON MINE AND THEN I STARTED A NEW TOPIC
5022-29405-0018 I MUST TELL YOU THAT LADY RACHEL IS THE ELDEST SHE IS MARRIED TO THE HONORABLE CAPTAIN MILLBAY OF THE NAVY NOW AWAY IN HIS SHIP A PERSON OF EXTRAORDINARY STRENGTH OF MIND I DON'T MEAN THE CAPTAIN I MEAN LADY RACHEL
5022-29405-0032 AND TRIED TO RESIST ME WHEN I INSISTED ON RELIEVING HER OF THE BASKET MISTER GERARD SHE PROTESTED
5022-29405-0039 WHAT I HAD READ OF HIS WRITING DISPOSED ME NOW THAT I SAW THE MAN BY DAYLIGHT TO FIND SOMETHING DEVILISH IN THE EXPRESSION OF HIS FACE NO STRONG AS IT WAS MY PREJUDICE FAILED TO MAKE ANY DISCOVERIES THAT PRESENTED HIM AT A DISADVANTAGE
5022-29411-0002 IF I HAD BEEN A PHILOSOPHER I SHOULD HAVE RECOGNIZED THE SYMPTOMS OF A VERY COMMON ATTACK OF A VERY WIDELY SPREAD MORAL MALADY THE MEANEST OF ALL HUMAN INFIRMITIES IS ALSO THE MOST UNIVERSAL AND THE NAME OF IT IS SELF ESTEEM
5022-29411-0016 OLD TOLLER WAS ALONE IN HIS KITCHEN EVIDENTLY ANNOYED AND ANGRY WE ARE ALL AT SIXES AND SEVENS MISTER GERARD I'VE HAD ANOTHER ROW WITH THAT DEAF DEVIL MY NEW NAME FOR HIM AND I THINK IT'S RATHER CLEVER
5022-29411-0023 YOU WILL ASK ME WHO THE PERSON IS
5022-29411-0030 WHO IS SHE I FOLLOWED AT MY HUMBLE DISTANCE THE EXAMPLE OF SIR WALTER SCOTT WHEN INQUISITIVE PEOPLE ASKED HIM IF HE WAS THE AUTHOR OF THE WAVERLEY NOVELS IN PLAIN ENGLISH I DENIED ALL KNOWLEDGE OF THE STRANGER WEARING THE GREEN HAT
5022-29411-0044 WHILE IT DIMMED THE TURBID EARTHY YELLOW THAT DISCOLORED AND DEGRADED THE STREAM UNDER THE FULL GLARE OF DAY WHILE MY EYES FOLLOWED THE SUCCESSIVE TRANSFORMATIONS OF THE VIEW AS THE HOUR ADVANCED TENDER AND SOLEMN INFLUENCES BREATHED THEIR BALM OVER MY MIND
5022-29411-0051 THERE WAS AN HYSTERICAL DEFIANCE IN HER MANNER ARE YOU EXCITED ARE YOU ANGRY ARE YOU TRYING TO STARTLE ME BY ACTING A PART I URGED THOSE QUESTIONS ON HER ONE AFTER ANOTHER AND I WAS LOUDLY AND CONFIDENTLY ANSWERED
5022-29411-0058 INTO ASSOCIATING CRISTEL'S AGITATION WITH SOMETHING WHICH THIS MAN MIGHT HAVE SAID TO HER I WAS ON THE POINT OF PUTTING THE QUESTION WHEN SHE HELD UP HER HAND AND SAID HUSH THE WIND WAS BLOWING TOWARDS US FROM THE RIVER SIDE VILLAGE TO WHICH I HAVE ALREADY ALLUDED
5049-25947-0001 BLOCKING THE WAY TO SANTIAGO
5049-25947-0008 WHICH WERE BEING HURLED AT THE BEACH LIKE SLEDS DOWN A WATER CHUTE IT WAS ONE OF THE MOST WEIRD AND REMARKABLE SCENES OF THE WAR PROBABLY OF ANY WAR
5049-25947-0015 TO DISTINGUISH THE OTHER COLUMN AS SOON AS THE ROUGH RIDERS HAD REACHED THE TOP OF THE RIDGE NOT TWENTY MINUTES AFTER THEY HAD LEFT CAMP WHICH WAS THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY THAT PRESENTED ITSELF COLONEL WOOD ORDERED CAPTAIN CAPRON
5049-25947-0029 THROUGH THE TWO HOURS OF FIGHTING THAT FOLLOWED ALTHOUGH MEN WERE FALLING ALL AROUND US THE SPANIARDS ON THE RIDGE WERE THE ONLY ONES THAT MANY OF US SAW BUT THE FIRE AGAINST US WAS NOT MORE THAN EIGHTY YARDS AWAY
5049-25947-0036 LIEUTENANT COLONEL ROOSEVELT RAN UP JUST THEN BRINGING WITH HIM LIEUTENANT WOODBURY KANE AND TEN TROOPERS FROM K TROOP ROOSEVELT LAY DOWN IN THE GRASS BESIDE LLEWELLYN AND CONSULTED WITH HIM EAGERLY
5049-25947-0043 G TROOP MEANWHILE HAD HURRIED OVER TO THE LEFT AND PASSING THROUGH THE OPENING IN THE WIRE FENCE HAD SPREAD OUT INTO OPEN ORDER IT FOLLOWED DOWN AFTER CAPTAIN LUNA'S TROOP AND D AND E TROOPS
5049-25947-0057 THE WALK DOWN THAT TRAIL PRESENTED ONE OF THE MOST GREWSOME PICTURES OF THE WAR
5049-25947-0064 YOU'RE TAKING ME TO THE FRONT AREN'T YOU YOU SAID YOU WOULD THEY'VE KILLED MY CAPTAIN DO YOU UNDERSTAND THEY'VE KILLED CAPTAIN CAPRON THE MEXICANS THEY'VE KILLED MY CAPTAIN
5049-25947-0071 A BOY WAS LYING WITH A BULLET WOUND BETWEEN HIS EYES HIS CHEST WAS HEAVING WITH SHORT HOARSE NOISES WHICH I GUESSED WERE DUE TO SOME MUSCULAR ACTION ENTIRELY AND THAT HE WAS VIRTUALLY DEAD
5049-25947-0084 FOR THEIR ARMS HAD BEEN ISSUED TO THEM SO SOON BEFORE SAILING THAT THEY HAD ONLY DRILLED WITH THEM WITHOUT USING CARTRIDGES TO THIS HANDICAP WAS ALSO ADDED THE NATURE OF THE GROUND
5049-25947-0098 SOME OF THE MEN WHO WERE TWICE DAY'S AGE BEGGED HIM TO LET THEM TAKE THE ENEMY'S IMPROMPTU FORT ON THE RUN BUT HE ANSWERED THEM TOLERANTLY LIKE SPOILED CHILDREN AND HELD THEM DOWN UNTIL THERE WAS A LULL IN THE ENEMY'S FIRE
5049-25947-0112 YOU CAN START AT ONCE BUT IF YOU WAIT UNTIL TO MORROW WHEN I CAN SPARE THE MEN YOU CAN BE CARRIED ALL THE WAY
5049-25947-0119 IT WAS WHAT FIRST TOLD HALF THE MEN WHERE THE OTHER HALF WERE AND IT MADE EVERY INDIVIDUAL MAN FEEL BETTER AS WE KNEW IT WAS ONLY A BLUFF THE FIRST CHEER WAS WAVERING
5049-25947-0126 THE EAGER SPIRIT IN WHICH THIS WAS ACCOMPLISHED IS BEST DESCRIBED IN THE SPANISH SOLDIER'S ANSWER TO THE INQUIRING CIVILIAN THEY TRIED TO CATCH US WITH THEIR HANDS
5104-33406-0013 HIS MEN POUNDED ON THE TABLES AND SHOUTED YES YES ANYWHERE BEHIND ERIC

5322-7678-0037 BUT HE FELT TIRED TO DEATH AND PEERED ROUND AT EVERY BUSH AND TREE WITH PARTICULAR ATTENTION AND ALMOST WITH TERROR EXPECTING EVERY MOMENT TO BE CALLED TO ACCOUNT FOR HIS LIFE
5322-7679-0004 HE HAD COME UPON THE NIZHNI PROTOTSK POST ON THE TEREK OPPOSITE A PRO RUSSIAN TARTAR VILLAGE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE RIVER HE ACCOSTED THE COSSACKS BUT NOT FINDING AS YET ANY EXCUSE FOR DOING ANYONE A KINDNESS HE ENTERED THE HUT

5339-14133-0007 BUT THIS IT WAS EVIDENT WOULD NOT HAVE SATISFIED THEIR MASTERS WHO WERE SCRUPULOUS IN INSISTING THAT WHATEVER ADVANTAGE THERE WAS SHOULD ALWAYS FALL ON THE SIDE OF THE YOUNGER MEN WHEN PHILIP SAW SYLVIA SHE WAS ALWAYS QUIET AND GENTLE
5339-14133-0014 AND YET THESE MUST BE REACHED BEFORE JUNE OR THE YEAR'S EXPEDITION WOULD BE OF LITTLE AVAIL EVERY BLACKSMITH'S SHOP RUNG WITH THE RHYTHMICAL CLANG OF BUSY HAMMERS BEATING OUT OLD IRON SUCH AS HORSESHOES NAILS OR STUBS INTO THE GREAT HARPOONS
5339-14133-0021 IS HE HERE AGAIN SAID PHILIP I DIDN'T SEE HIM WHAT BRINGS HIM HERE
5339-14133-0035 AS A FAVOURABLE SYMPTOM OR OTHERWISE BY AND BY LUCKILY FOR HIM IN SOME TURN OF HER ARM TO REACH THE SCISSORS ON THE TABLE SHE CAUGHT THE EDGE OF HER WORK BASKET AND DOWN IT FELL SHE STOOPED TO PICK UP THE SCATTERED STOCKINGS AND BALL OF WORSTED
5339-14133-0042 HE HAD INTENDED IF NECESSARY TO ACKNOWLEDGE HIS WISHES AND DESIRES WITH REGARD TO SYLVIA TO HER PARENTS BUT FOR VARIOUS REASONS HE WAS NOT SORRY THAT CIRCUMSTANCES
5339-14133-0049 BUT SHE WEARY OF A SUBJECT SHE CARED NOTHING ABOUT AND EAGER TO IDENTIFY HERSELF WITH ALL HIS INTERESTS ASKED HIM ABOUT HIS PLANS ALMOST AT THE SAME TIME THAT HE SAID THESE LAST WORDS AND THEY WENT ON AS LOVERS DO
5339-14134-0006 IT WAS APPARENTLY BY JOHN FOSTER'S WISH THAT PHILIP HAD BEEN SUMMONED JEREMIAH THE LESS ENERGETIC AND DECIDED BROTHER WAS STILL DISCUSSING THE PROPRIETY OF THE STEP WHEN PHILIP ENTERED
5339-14134-0013 AND HE HAD ONLY BEEN BROUGHT PARTIALLY TO CONSENT TO THE SENDING OF HEPBURN BY HIS BROTHER'S PLEDGING HIMSELF THAT THE REAL NATURE OF PHILIP'S ERRAND SHOULD BE UNKNOWN TO ANY HUMAN CREATURE SAVE THEM THREE AS ALL THIS WAS BEING REVEALED TO PHILIP HE SAT APPARENTLY UNMOVED AND SIMPLY ATTENTIVE
5339-14134-0020 THAT GREAT CITY OF LONDON WHICH FROM ITS VERY INACCESSIBILITY FIFTY YEARS AGO LOOMED SO MAGNIFICENT THROUGH THE MIST OF MEN'S IMAGINATIONS IT IS NOT TO BE DENIED THAT PHILIP FELT EXULTANT AT THE MERE FACT OF GOING TO LONDON BUT THEN AGAIN THE THOUGHT OF LEAVING SYLVIA
5339-14134-0034 GOING AND DOUBTING AND ENVYING PHILIP AS NIVER DID THEE AN ILL TURN OR SAID AN ILL WORD OR THOUGHT AN ILL THOUGHT BY THEE AND SENDING HIM AWAY OUT O T HOUSE THIS LAST NIGHT OF ALL
5339-14134-0041 AND CONVINCED OF HER GREAT LOVE TOWARDS HIMSELF HAD FORGOTTEN ANY PREVIOUS JEALOUSY OF PHILIP SECURE AND EXULTANT HIS BROAD HANDSOME WEATHER BRONZED FACE WAS AS GREAT A CONTRAST TO PHILIP'S LONG THOUGHTFUL SALLOW COUNTENANCE
5339-14134-0048 SO THEY PARTED BUT PHILIP HAD NOT GONE MANY STEPS BEFORE HIS UNCLE CALLED HIM BACK KINRAID SLOWLY LOITERING ON MEANWHILE
5339-14134-0062 ALMOST AS IF BESEECHING HER TO SHOW OR EXPRESS SOME SORROW AT A JOURNEY THE VERY DESTINATION OF WHICH SHOWED THAT HE WOULD BE ABSENT FOR SOME TIME TO LUNNON
5339-14134-0069 IT WERE YO'R OWN MOTHER SYLVIA AS KNOWED YO HAD NO BROTHER OR ANY ONE TO SEE AFTER YO AND YO SO PRETTY SO PRETTY SYLVIA HE CONTINUED SHAKING HIS HEAD SADLY THAT MEN RUN AFTER YO AGAINST THEIR WILL AS ONE MAY SAY

5390-24512-0010 YET THE KEENER THE SUFFERING THE MORE DESPERATE THE JEWS BECAME THEIR WHOLE SOULS WERE POSSESSED WITH A WILD AND MAD PASSION FOR REVENGE
5390-24512-0017 HE WAS A PRISONER IN THE ROMAN CAMP DURING THE SIEGE OF JERUSALEM AND HE WATCHED WITH DISMAY THE GREAT BATTERING RAMS AND WAR ENGINES CRASHING THROUGH THE WALLS OF THE HOLY CITY HIS EARS RANG WITH THE CRIES OF RAGE AND DESPAIR WHICH BROKE FROM THE JEWS WITHIN
5390-24512-0024 WHICH STILL GLITTERED LIKE A HILL OF SNOW IN THE MORNING SUNSHINE OR SPARKLED AS THOUGH WRAPPED IN FLAME WHEN THE SUNBEAMS STRUCK FULL ON ITS GOLDEN ROOF THEN REDDER FLAMES THAN EVER THE SUNSHINE MADE LEAPT ABOVE THE GOLDEN ROOF
5390-24512-0037 THAT IS CLEAN ACCORDING TO THE LAW OF MOSES THE INK YOU WRITE WITH MUST BE OF A PURE BLACK MADE ONLY FROM A MIXTURE OF SOOT CHARCOAL AND HONEY
5390-24512-0044 AND SO ON NOT ONLY THIS BUT EVERY SCRIBE WAS REQUIRED TO KNOW FROM MEMORY EXACTLY HOW MANY LETTERS OF EACH KIND THERE SHOULD BE IN HIS SHEET BEFORE HE BEGAN TO WRITE EVERY SHEET OF PARCHMENT MUST CONTAIN AN EQUAL NUMBER OF LINES
5390-30096-0001 REPLIED THE MAJOR COMPOSEDLY IT'S A PART OF MY DUTY IN ATTENDING TO THOSE AFFAIRS YOU WON'T LOOK AFTHER YOURSELF TO LEND CERTAIN SUMS OF YOUR MONEY TO NEEDY AND AMBITIOUS YOUNG MEN WHO WANT A START IN LIFE OH UNCLE
5390-30096-0015 THAT HE HAD BEEN INSTRUMENTAL IN FOUNDING BEING NO LONGER ABSORBED IN BUSINESS HE HAD COME TO DETEST ITS EVERY DETAIL AND SO ALLOWED HIS BANKERS TO CARE FOR HIS FORTUNE AND HIS BROTHER IN LAW TO DISBURSE HIS INCOME
5390-30096-0022 HE WAS IN A BAD FIX ANOTHER FELLOW WAS CONTESTING HIS PATENT AND FIGHTING HARD TO HEAD HIM OFF IT WOULD TAKE A LOT OF MONEY TO FIGHT BACK THREE THOUSAND AT LEAST
5390-30096-0029 FOR A TIME HE ATE WITH GREAT DELIBERATION AND REVOLVED AN INTERESTING THOUGHT IN HIS MIND YEARS AGO
5390-30102-0009 THE PLAIN FOLKS AROUND MILLVILLE MIGHT SPECULATE LISTLESSLY UPON THE QUEER DOIN'S AT THE FARM AND NEVER GET ANYWHERE NEAR THE TRUTH INDEED THE STRANGE OCCURRENCES SHE HAD JUST HEARD
5390-30102-0016 THE BOY FLED AND LEFT HIS SWEETHEART WITHOUT A WORD WHY UNLESS SOMETHING HAD OCCURRED THAT RENDERED THEIR MARRIAGE IMPOSSIBLE IN THE FIFTH PLACE THERE WAS OLD HUCKS AND HIS BLIND WIFE TO BE CONSIDERED
5390-30102-0023 BUT HE TURNED WITHOUT A WORD TO HARNESS THE HORSE LOUISE STOOD WATCHING HIM YOUR FINGERS ARE QUITE NIMBLE THOMAS CONSIDERING THE FACT THAT YOU WERE ONCE A SAILOR SHE SAID BUT SAILORS HAVE TO BE NIMBLE MISS HE RETURNED

5456-24741-0006 IN OTHER WORDS IT WILL HAVE THE IDEA WHICH DOES NOT EXCLUDE BUT POSTULATES THE EXISTENCE OR PRESENCE OF THE NATURE OF THE EXTERNAL BODY
5456-24741-0019 AND HENCE WE CAN FURTHER CLEARLY UNDERSTAND WHY THE MIND FROM THE THOUGHT OF ONE THING SHOULD STRAIGHTWAY ARRIVE AT THE THOUGHT OF ANOTHER THING WHICH HAS NO SIMILARITY WITH THE FIRST FOR INSTANCE FROM THE THOUGHT OF THE WORD POMUM AN APPLE

5463-39173-0019 BUT THAT IF THE PRICE OF DANDY COULD BE REMITTED TO HIM AT ONCE IT WOULD GREATLY FACILITATE HIS OBJECT NOTHING COULD BE MORE DIFFERENT THAN MISTER SOWERBY'S TONE ABOUT MONEY AT DIFFERENT TIMES WHEN HE WANTED TO RAISE THE WIND EVERYTHING WAS SO IMPORTANT
5463-39173-0026 BUT WHAT WOULD THE WORLD COME TO IF NONE BUT ABSOLUTE TRUE HEROES WERE TO BE THOUGHT WORTHY OF WOMEN'S LOVE WHAT WOULD THE MEN DO AND WHAT OH WHAT WOULD BECOME OF THE WOMEN

5463-39173-0047 TO SIT STILL AND NOT BE ADMIRED WOULD ALMOST SUFFICE FOR HER I DO NOT WORSHIP LADY LUFTON AS YOU DO BUT I THINK QUITE WELL ENOUGH OF HER TO WONDER THAT SHE SHOULD CHOOSE SUCH A GIRL AS THAT FOR HER SON'S WIFE THAT SHE DOES WISH IT I DO NOT DOUBT
5463-39173-0054 WHICH THEY KNEW IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO INTRODUCE IN MISTER CRAWLEY'S PRESENCE SHE AS WE HAVE SAID WAS NOT QUITE SO GAUNT NOT ALTOGETHER SO HAGGARD AS IN THE LATTER OF THOSE DREADFUL CORNISH DAYS LADY LUFTON AND MISSUS ARABIN BETWEEN THEM
5463-39173-0061 BUT ALWAYS WITH A MUTUAL ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF EACH OTHER'S TRUTH NOW THEY LIVED COMPARATIVELY NEAR TOGETHER BUT NO OPPORTUNITIES AROSE FOR SUCH DISCUSSIONS AT ANY RATE ONCE A QUARTER MISTER CRAWLEY WAS PRESSED BY HIS OLD FRIEND TO VISIT HIM AT THE DEANERY
5463-39174-0011 THAT HIS HOPES AND EXPECTATIONS DID NOT GO HAND IN HAND TOGETHER BY THE BY HE DESIRED US TO SAY THAT HE WILL CALL HERE TO MORROW AT ABOUT ELEVEN DIDN'T HE SAY FANNY YES
5463-39174-0018 AND THEN THE BAG IN A SOLEMN MANNER WAS CARRIED OVER TO THEIR MOTHER WHO TAKING IT FROM HER SON'S HANDS LAID IT HIGH ON A BOOKSHELF AND NOT ONE NOW SAID LUCY ROBARTS VERY PITEOUSLY DON'T BE SO HARD MISTER CRAWLEY NOT UPON THEM BUT UPON ME
5463-39174-0025 IT WAS ON LUCY'S TONGUE TO SAY THAT HER LADYSHIP WAS PRETTY NEARLY AS BAD BUT SHE STOPPED HERSELF AT THIS MOMENT PROVIDENCE SENT GREAT RELIEF TO MISS ROBARTS IN THE SHAPE OF MISSUS CRAWLEY'S RED ARMED MAID OF ALL WORK WHO WALKING UP TO HER MASTER
5463-39174-0039 OH NO I COULD NOT PUNISH YOU FOR YOUR GOODNESS IN THAT WAY BUT HE WOULD NOT GO HE COULD GO AND LEAVE ME AT HOME SOMETIMES I HAVE THOUGHT THAT IT MIGHT BE SO AND I HAVE DONE ALL IN MY POWER TO PERSUADE HIM I HAVE TOLD HIM THAT IF HE COULD MIX ONCE MORE WITH THE WORLD WITH THE CLERICAL WORLD YOU KNOW
5463-39174-0046 AND MOREOVER THE GINGERBREAD HAD BEEN TAKEN DOWN IN THE AUDACITY OF THEIR COMMERCIAL SPECULATIONS AND THE NUTS WERE SPREAD OUT UPON A BOARD BEHIND WHICH LUCY STOOD AS SHOP GIRL DISPOSING OF THEM FOR KISSES MAMMA MAMMA SAID BOBBY RUNNING UP TO HIS MOTHER YOU MUST BUY SOMETHING OF HER
5514-19192-0002 IT WAS PARTICULARLY ZEALOUS AND INTREPID IN THE DAYS OF JUNE EIGHTEEN THIRTY TWO
5514-19192-0015 AND HAD SHOUTED DEATH ON THE SIXTH OF JUNE EIGHTEEN THIRTY TWO A COMPANY OF THE NATIONAL GUARDS FROM THE SUBURBS COMMANDED BY THE CAPTAIN FANNICOT ABOVE MENTIONED
5514-19192-0022 WERE MOWN DOWN POINT BLANK AT THE VERY FOOT OF THE REDOUBT AND THIS COURAGEOUS THRONG OF NATIONAL GUARDS VERY BRAVE MEN BUT LACKING IN MILITARY TENACITY WERE FORCED TO FALL BACK AFTER SOME HESITATION LEAVING FIFTEEN CORPSES ON THE PAVEMENT
5514-19192-0029 THUS THEY ARE STRUGGLES OF ONE AGAINST A HUNDRED WHICH ALWAYS END IN CRUSHING THE BARRICADE UNLESS THE REVOLUTION UPRISING SUDDENLY FLINGS INTO THE BALANCE ITS FLAMING ARCHANGEL'S SWORD THIS DOES HAPPEN SOMETIMES
5514-19192-0043 THEY DELAYED THE ATTACK ON THE BARRICADES MAUBUEE
5514-19192-0050 COULD NOW BE CONCENTRATED ON THE THREE OR FOUR BARRICADES WHICH STILL REMAINED STANDING THE SUN WAS MOUNTING ABOVE THE HORIZON
5514-19193-0006 HAD ANY ONE BEEN NEAR HIM THAT PERSON WOULD HAVE HEARD HIM MUTTER IN A LOW VOICE PATRIA
5514-19193-0020 GAVROCHE REPLIED WELL IT IS RAINING WHAT THEN COURFEYRAC SHOUTED COME IN INSTANTER SAID GAVROCHE AND WITH A SINGLE BOUND HE PLUNGED INTO THE STREET
5514-19193-0027 FOR THIRST SAID HE PUTTING IT IN HIS POCKET BY DINT OF ADVANCING HE REACHED A POINT WHERE THE FOG OF THE FUSILLADE BECAME TRANSPARENT SO THAT THE SHARPSHOOTERS OF THE LINE RANGED ON THE OUTLOOK BEHIND THEIR PAVING STONE DIKE
5514-19193-0034 EVERY TIME THAT THE FLAT NOSED FACE OF THE SPECTRE APPROACHED THE URCHIN ADMINISTERED TO IT A FILLIP ONE BULLET HOWEVER BETTER AIMED OR MORE TREACHEROUS THAN THE REST FINALLY STRUCK THE WILL O' THE WISP OF A CHILD
5561-39621-0012 DRAWN LIKE A CARRIAGE BY FOUR BLACK HORSES
5561-39621-0019 ALL THE NOISE ALL THE SPLENDOR HAD PASSED AWAY AT THE ANGLE OF THE STREET THERE REMAINED NOTHING BENEATH THE STRANGER BUT A FEW HOARSE DISCORDANT VOICES SHOUTING AT INTERVALS VIVE LE ROI
5561-39621-0026 CAN YOU DOUBT MY ENERGY I HAVE MEDITATED THIS JOURNEY TEN YEARS IN SPITE OF ALL COUNSELS AND ALL OBSTACLES HAVE YOU FAITH IN MY PERSEVERANCE
5561-39621-0040 WELL WELL MY LORD SAID PARRY MORE UNEASY AT THE TURN THE CONVERSATION HAD TAKEN THAN AT THE OTHER YOU KNOW RESUMED THE UNKNOWN THAT MY MOTHER AND MY SISTER WHILST ALL THIS IS GOING ON IN HONOR OF THE KING OF FRANCE HAVE NEITHER MONEY NOR BREAD YOU KNOW THAT I MYSELF SHALL BE POOR AND DEGRADED WITHIN A FORTNIGHT
5561-41615-0001 THE MAJORITY HOWEVER APPEARED TO BE HIGHLY DELIGHTED OVER WHAT THEY HEARD ONE GROUP STANDING NEAR ONE OF THE WINDOWS OF WHICH ELEANOR WAS THE CENTER LAUGHED SO LOUDLY THAT THEY WERE SENT TO THEIR SEATS
5561-41615-0008 AND DID YOU SIGN IT ASKED JESSICA I CERTAINLY DID NOT RESPONDED MABEL IT WAS SHE STOPPED THEN FLUSHED
5561-41615-0022 HER EXAMPLE WAS FOLLOWED UNTIL TWO THIRDS OF THE GIRLS PRESENT WERE STANDING THE PRINCIPAL STOOD SILENTLY REGARDING THEM WITH AN EXPRESSION OF SEVERITY THAT WAS DECIDEDLY DISCOMFITTING THAT WILL DO SHE SAID CURTLY
5561-41615-0029 WITH THESE WORDS ELEANOR ANGRILY FLUNG THE BOOK SHE HELD ON THE DESK AND WALKED DOWN THE AISLE TOWARD THE DOOR BUT MISS THOMPSON BARRED HER WAY STOP MISS SAVELL SHE COMMANDED
5561-41615-0036 THE GIRLS SILENTLY DONNED THEIR WRAPS AND FLED FROM THE BUILDING LIKE FUGITIVES FROM JUSTICE ONCE ON THE STREET A LIVELY CONFAB ENSUED ALL TALKING AT ONCE LET'S TAKE TURNS TALKING CRIED GRACE LAUGHING WE SHALL UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER A LITTLE BETTER
5561-41616-0001 AFTER CONDUCTING OPENING EXERCISES MISS THOMPSON PRONOUNCED SENTENCE ON THE CULPRITS THEY WERE TO FORFEIT THEIR RECESS LIBRARY AND ALL OTHER PRIVILEGES UNTIL THE END OF THE TERM
5561-41616-0008 GRACE HUMMED A FEW BARS THE VERY THING SHE EXCLAIMED NOW ANNE GET BUSY AT ONCE YOU'D BETTER SING THE TUNE TO YOURSELF ALL THE TIME YOU'RE WRITING IT
5561-41616-0015 JULIA CROSBY AND GRACE TOOK TURNS SPRINTING AROUND THE GYMNASIUM THREE TIMES IN SUCCESSION WHILE MIRIAM NESBIT TIMED THEM GRACE FINISHING JUST TWO SECONDS AHEAD OF JULIA BY A QUARTER OF TWO THE GALLERY WAS FAIRLY WELL FILLED AND BY FIVE MINUTES OF TWO IT WAS CROWDED
5561-41616-0029 THEN THE SENIORS SCORED TWICE ON FOULS TYING THE SCORE THE JUNIORS SET THEIR TEETH AND WADED IN WITH ALL THEIR MIGHT AND MAIN SETTING A WHIRLWIND PACE THAT CAUSED THEIR FANS TO SHOUT WITH WILD ENTHUSIASM AND FAIRLY DAZED THEIR OPPONENTS GRACE ALONE NETTED FOUR FOUL GOALS
5561-41616-0036 HARD TO TELL SAID NORA THEY HISSED MISS THOMPSON VERY SOFTLY YOU MAY BE SURE CONTINUED JESSICA BUT IT WAS HISSING JUST THE SAME
5652-19215-0004 THE TRANSITION HAD NOT BEEN SOFTENED AND THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN STUNNED HAD THEY NOT BEEN DAZZLED BY IT DO YOU UNDERSTAND ANYTHING ABOUT IT SAID MARIUS TO COSETTE NO REPLIED COSETTE BUT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE GOOD GOD IS CARING FOR US
5652-19215-0017 IT IS TRUE THAT HE OVERWHELMED HER WITH GALLANT COMPLIMENTS AND PRESENTS WHILE JEAN VALJEAN WAS BUILDING UP FOR COSETTE A NORMAL SITUATION IN SOCIETY AND AN UNASSAILABLE STATUS
5652-19215-0031 FRESHLY DECORATED VIOLET EBONY AND CALICO MAKE WAY MAKE WAY THE SIEUR CURMUDGEON IS MARRYING MADEMOISELLE CLUTCH PENNY SUMPTUOUSNESS AND SPLENDOR
5652-19215-0045 OR A TUFT OF ROSES WHETHER HE WAS A SHEPHERD OR A WARRIOR AND IF BY CHANCE ONE WAS A CAPTAIN OF DRAGOONS
5652-19215-0052 WHAT THE DEUCE MARRY WHEN YOU MARRY WITH FEVER AND GIDDINESS AND TUMULT AND THE UPROAR OF HAPPINESS BE GRAVE IN CHURCH WELL AND GOOD BUT AS SOON AS THE MASS IS FINISHED
5652-19215-0059 SOMEWHAT RESENTFUL IN HER INMOST SOUL
5652-39938-0010 NOT OURS IS THE TASK OF ANALYZING SPECIAL METHODS OF NEUROLOGICAL AND MENTAL DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS SUCH AS ARE USED IN THE PSYCHIATRIC CLINIC AND IN THE OFFICE OF THE NERVE SPECIALIST THERE THE FAMILY HISTORY WITH REFERENCE TO NERVOUS AND OTHER DISEASES
5652-39938-0017 MOST OF THE ADJUSTMENT OF METHOD MUST BE LEFT TO THE INSTINCT OF THE PHYSICIAN IN WHICH WIDE EXPERIENCE SOLID KNOWLEDGE TACT AND SYMPATHY OUGHT TO BE BLENDED EVEN THE WAY IN WHICH THE PATIENT REACTS ON THE METHOD WILL OFTEN GUIDE THE INSTINCT OF THE WELL TRAINED PSYCHOTHERAPIST
5652-39938-0024 NAMELY TO REMOVE THE EXTERNAL SOURCES OF THE DISTURBANCE EXTERNAL INDICATES THERE NOT ONLY THE OUTER WORLD BUT ALSO THE OWN BODY OUTSIDE THE CONSCIOUS PARTS OF THE BRAIN
5652-39938-0038 AND LOSS OF SLEEP IS CERTAINLY ONE OF THE MOST PERNICIOUS CONDITIONS FOR THE BRAIN AGAIN REST IS A GREAT FACTOR IN THOSE SYSTEMATIC REST CURES WHICH FOR A LONG WHILE WERE ALMOST THE FASHION WITH THE NEUROLOGIST
5652-39938-0045 EARLIER TIMES SURELY MAY HAVE TREATED EVEN THE STRONGER VARIETIES OF THIS KIND AS TROUBLESOME VARIATIONS IN THE SPHERE OF THE NORMAL
5652-39938-0052 YET THAT QUIET COUNTRYMAN MAY REACT IN HIS NARROW SYSTEM NOT LESS WHEN THE MODEST CHANGES IN HIS SURROUNDINGS PROVOKE HIM THE GOSSIP OF HIS NEIGHBOR MAY UNDERMINE HIS NERVOUS SYSTEM JUST AS MUCH AS A POLITICAL FIGHT OR THE STRUGGLES OF THE EXCHANGE THAT OF THE CITY MAN
5652-39938-0066 EVERYTHING IS TO BE AVOIDED WHICH INTERFERES WITH THE NIGHT'S SLEEP
5678-43301-0006 AND CONVERGED TOWARDS THE WIDE RAILED SPACE ABOUT THE PLATFORM WHERE ROOM WAS RESERVED FOR THEM THE WINDOWS ON EVERY SIDE WERE PACKED WITH FACES TALL STANDS WERE ERECTED ALONG THE FRONT OF THE NATIONAL GALLERY AND SAINT MARTIN'S CHURCH
5678-43301-0013 THERE WAS NO DOUBT THAT THESE LONDONERS COULD SING IT WAS AS IF A GIANT VOICE HUMMED THE SONOROUS MELODY RISING TO ENTHUSIASM TILL THE MUSIC OF MASSED BANDS FOLLOWED IT AS A FLAG FOLLOWS A FLAG STICK THE HYMN WAS ONE COMPOSED TEN YEARS BEFORE
5678-43301-0027 THE OLD MAN AT THE TABLE WAS UP IN A MOMENT AND SIMULTANEOUSLY A VIOLENT COMMOTION BUBBLED AND HEAVED LIKE WATER ABOUT A ROCK AT A POINT IN THE CROWD IMMEDIATELY OUTSIDE THE RAILED SPACE WHERE THE BANDS WERE MASSED AND DIRECTLY OPPOSITE THE FRONT OF THE PLATFORM
5678-43302-0006 I SAID THAT BRAITHWAITE HAD DONE MORE FOR THE WORLD BY ONE SPEECH THAN JESUS AND ALL HIS SAINTS PUT TOGETHER HE WAS AWARE THAT THE KNITTING NEEDLES STOPPED FOR A SECOND THEN THEY WENT ON AGAIN AS BEFORE
5678-43302-0013 WELL DESERVED FATE OF ASSASSIN HE WAS PLEASED TOO THAT HE HONESTLY HAD DONE HIS BEST TO SAVE THE MAN EVEN IN THAT MOMENT OF SUDDEN AND ACUTE PAIN HE HAD CRIED OUT FOR A FAIR TRIAL BUT HE HAD BEEN TOO LATE
5678-43302-0027 NO MY DEAR YOU'RE EXCITED AND TIRED IT'S JUST A LITTLE SENTIMENT OLIVER I DON'T THINK I WOULD SAY THAT KIND OF THING BEFORE HER BUT SHE HEARS IT EVERYWHERE NOW NO SHE DOESN'T REMEMBER
5678-43302-0034 BUT HER IMAGINATION SIMPLY REFUSED TO GRASP IT A DUEL OF EAST AND WEST UNDER THESE NEW CONDITIONS WAS AN UNTHINKABLE THING THERE HAD BEEN NO EUROPEAN WAR WITHIN LIVING MEMORY AND THE EASTERN WARS OF THE LAST CENTURY HAD BEEN UNDER THE OLD CONDITIONS
5678-43303-0000 MABEL REMEMBERED HER HUSBAND'S ADVICE TO WATCH AND FOR A FEW DAYS DID HER BEST BUT THERE WAS NOTHING THAT ALARMED HER THE OLD LADY WAS A LITTLE QUIET PERHAPS BUT WENT ABOUT HER MINUTE AFFAIRS AS USUAL SHE ASKED THE GIRL TO READ TO HER SOMETIMES
5678-43303-0014 BUT THAT PARTICULAR EMOTION WAS GONE IT WAS FOOLISH TO THINK THAT IT WAS SOUNDING ETERNALLY ELSEWHERE FOR THERE WAS NO ELSEWHERE SHE TOO HERSELF WOULD CEASE ONE DAY LET HER SEE TO IT THAT THE TONE WAS PURE AND LOVELY
5678-43303-0021 HE WILL BE BACK TO DINNER WILL HE NOT IF THE VOLOR IS NOT LATE NOW MOTHER ARE YOU READY FOR BREAKFAST MABEL PASSED AN AFTERNOON OF CONSIDERABLE AGITATION IT WAS CERTAIN THAT SOMETHING HAD HAPPENED
5678-43303-0028 TURNING AGAIN AND AGAIN TO THE WINDOW LISTENING TO THE SOFT RUSH OF THE TRAINS THE FAINT HOOTS FROM THE TRACK AND THE MUSICAL CHORDS FROM THE JUNCTION A MILE AWAY THE LIGHTS WERE UP BY NOW AND THE VAST SWEEP OF THE TOWNS LOOKED LIKE FAIRYLAND BETWEEN THE EARTHLY LIGHT
5688-15787-0002 WE WERE THEN ONLY TWELVE OR FOURTEEN MILES FROM FOREST CREEK AND I PROPOSED LOOKING FOR FRESH LODGINGS AS THE HOUSE WE WERE STAYING AT WAS ANYTHING BUT RESPECTABLE THIS WAS AGREED TO AND WE SEARCHED AND WERE SUCCESSFUL IN FINDING GOOD BEDS
5688-15787-0016 THE PLACE WAS NOT RUSHED THE SECOND NIGHT BUT WE NEVERTHELESS ADDED FOUR POUNDS MORE TO OUR TREASURY AFTER A GOOD NIGHT'S REST WE GOT UP AND PREPARED TO START
5688-15787-0030 GOT BACK SAFELY AND ENJOYED OUR DINNER AFTER WHICH WE HAD A LONG YARN ABOUT DIGGING
5688-15787-0037 IF YOU ARE LUCKY COME AND PAY AND IN THE MEANTIME GIVE ME YOUR NAMES FOR THE ACCOUNT SO THAT IF YOU HAVE TO LEAVE I MAY HAVE A CLAIM ON THE TENT WE CONSULTED TOGETHER AND AGREED TO HIS TERMS WE THEN HAD NOBBLERS ALL ROUND TOOK POSSESSION OF OUR GOODS AND MOVED INTO OUR NEW TENT
5688-15787-0044 WE GOT DOWN ABOUT FOUR FEET THE FIRST DAY AND WERE VERY TIRED OUR HANDS NOT BEING USED TO PICK AND SHOVEL WORK WERE VERY SORE THE NEXT DAY WE EXPECTED TO BOTTOM THE HOLE THE DIGGERS TOLD US THAT WE SHOULD STRIKE THE PIPE CLAY AT ABOUT SEVEN FEET
5688-41232-0012 IS NOT THE ORDINARY WORD FOR THINGS PHYSICALLY FOUL IT IS A RITUAL TERM AND CORRESPONDS EXACTLY TO THE IDEA OF TABOO THE IDEAS UNCLEAN AND HOLY SEEM TO US TO STAND IN POLAR OPPOSITION TO ONE ANOTHER
5688-41232-0019 THE OBJECT OF SECLUDING WOMEN AT MENSTRUATION IS TO NEUTRALIZE THE DANGEROUS INFLUENCES WHICH ARE SUPPOSED TO EMANATE FROM THEM AT SUCH TIMES THE GENERAL EFFECT OF THESE RULES IS TO KEEP THE GIRL SUSPENDED SO TO SAY BETWEEN HEAVEN AND EARTH
5688-41232-0026 AND POINTS OUT THAT IT IS NOT ONLY AT PUBERTY AND EACH RECURRENCE OF THE MENSTRUAL EPOCH THAT WOMEN HAVE AROUSED THESE EMOTIONS BUT ALSO AT CHILDBIRTH A SENTIMENT OF RELIGIOUS HORROR HE CONTINUES
5688-41232-0040 OH MENSTRUATING WOMAN THOU'RT A FIEND FROM WHOM ALL NATURE SHOULD BE CLOSELY SCREENED HER POWERS ARE ALSO BENEFICIAL
5688-41232-0047 ASKING WHETHER IT WAS TRUE THAT IF A WOMAN CURED HAMS WHILE MENSTRUATING THE HAMS WOULD BE SPOILED HE HAD KNOWN THIS TO HAPPEN TWICE ANOTHER MEDICAL MAN WROTE THAT IF SO WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO THE PATIENTS OF MENSTRUATING LADY DOCTORS
5688-41232-0054 YET I HAVE NOT HESITATED TO PERFORM THESE OPERATIONS AT SUCH A TIME AND HAVE NEVER HAD REASON TO REGRET THE COURSE THE ONLY OPERATIONS THAT I SHOULD DISLIKE TO PERFORM DURING MENSTRUATION WOULD BE THOSE INVOLVING THE WOMB ITSELF
5688-41232-0068 SUCH A TASK MAY BEST BE UNDERTAKEN THROUGH THE MINUTE STUDY OF ISOLATED CASES AND IN THIS PLACE I AM MERELY CONCERNED WITH THE GENERAL INFLUENCE OF THE MENSTRUAL STATE
5688-41232-0075 AND THE GRADUAL EVOLUTION FROM ONE EXTREME OF THE MAGICAL DOCTRINE TO THE OTHER WAS INEVITABLE IN AN ADVANCED CIVILIZATION AS WE SEE THESE IDEAS HAVING THEIR ULTIMATE BASIS ON THE OLD STORY OF THE SERPENT
5703-47198-0005 IT'S VERY GOOD OF YOU TO TAKE SUCH AN INTEREST IN MY FATE JULIET REPLIED AS SHE PULLED OFF HER GLOVES AND WENT TO THE SIDE TABLE FOR THE LETTER AS A MATTER OF FACT SHE WAS A GOOD DEAL EXCITED NOW FOR WHAT THE CHILD SAID WAS TRUE ENOUGH
5703-47198-0019 NO MY DEAR YOU KNOW I HAVE NOT BESIDES I PROMISED LENA I WOULD NEVER ASK YOU ARE THE CHILD OF A FRIEND OF HERS THAT IS ALL I KNOW I THINK SHE SCARCELY REALIZED HOW HARD IT WOULD BE FOR YOU NOT TO KNOW MORE WHEN YOU GREW UP
5703-47198-0026 AT ALL EVENTS IF THEY DO NOT TURN OUT DESIRABLE I SHALL STILL BE HERE I HOPE SO I DON'T SEE HOW YOU CAN LOSE ANYTHING BY TAKING THIS CHANCE OF FINDING OUT WHAT YOU CAN ABOUT THEM AT THIS POINT LADY BYRNE CAME INTO THE ROOM
5703-47198-0033 SUPPOSING SHE IS DETAINED IN LONDON HE SAID WHAT SHOULD DETAIN HER DEMANDED HIS WIFE UNLESS IT IS THE DISCOVERY OF HER PARENTS AND IF SHE FINDS THEM I PRESUME THEY WILL BE CAPABLE OF LOOKING AFTER HER IN ANY CASE
5703-47198-0047 SHE WAS YOUNG STRONG AND HEALTHY AND THERE WAS NO REASON THAT TRIFLING DISCOMFORTS OF THIS KIND SHOULD AFFECT HER ENJOYMENT TO THE SHORTCOMINGS OF THE BED INDEED SHE SHUT HER EYES IN MORE SENSES THAN ONE
5703-47198-0054 ANYONE COULD HAVE TOLD HER THAT BY THIS ATTITUDE OF MIND TOWARDS THE FUTURE SHE WAS LAYING UP FOR HERSELF DISAPPOINTMENT AT THE LEAST IF NOT THE BITTEREST DISILLUSIONS BUT THERE WAS NO ONE TO THROW COLD WATER ON HER HOPES
5703-47212-0001 WAS A PICTURESQUE ADDITION TO THE LANDSCAPE AS SHE APPROACHED THE WOODEN LANDING STAGE THAT STOOD HALF A MILE BELOW THE PROMONTORY ON WHICH THE CASTLE WAS BUILT IT WAS THE MORNING OF FRIDAY THE DAY FOLLOWING THE FUNERAL
5703-47212-0015 WHICH HERE RAN ACROSS THE OPEN MOORLAND IT WAS DIFFICULT NOW TO CONTINUE THE PURSUIT UNOBSERVED AND GIMBLET BECAME ABSORBED IN THE CONTEMPLATION OF AN ENORMOUS CAIRNGORM
5703-47212-0022 AND THOUGH THE SHOPWOMAN PLAINLY DOUBTED HIS VERACITY AND KEPT A SHARP EYE THAT HE DID NOT TAKE TO HIS HEELS WITH THE CAIRNGORM SHE DID NOT GO SO FAR AS TO SUGGEST HIS REMOVING HIMSELF FROM THE ZONE OF TEMPTATION
5703-47212-0029 HE KEPT HOWEVER A STRICT EYE ON THE DOOR OF THE HOTEL AND AFTER A QUARTER OF AN HOUR SAW THE OBJECT OF HIS ATTENTIONS EMERGE WITH FISHING ROD AND BASKET
5703-47212-0042 AND IN THE BOWS OF THE VESSEL THE DETECTIVE CAUGHT SIGHT OF JULIA ROMANINOV'S TWEED CLAD FORM SHE WAS LEANING AGAINST THE RAIL AND GAZING AT A DISTANT PART OF THE LOCH WHERE A BLACK SPECK
5750-100289-0003 GIVING A FAIR KNOWLEDGE OF SOME TRADE TOGETHER WITH THE ESSENTIALS OF AN ENGLISH EDUCATION BUT NO LATIN OR OTHER FOREIGN LANGUAGE CONSEQUENTLY ITS GRADUATES MUST ATTEND A HIGHER PREPARATORY SCHOOL FOR SEVERAL YEARS BEFORE THEY CAN ENTER COLLEGE
5750-100289-0017 THE VERY MENTION OF THE NAME INDIAN IN EARLIER DAYS WOULD MAKE THE AVERAGE WHITE MAN'S BLOOD CREEP WITH THOUGHTS OF THE WAR WHOOP AND THE SCALPING KNIFE
5750-100289-0024 POLITICS AND HIGHER BUSINESS MANAGEMENT ART AND LITERATURE IT MAY BE WELL TO MENTION SOME OF OUR BEST KNOWN PROFESSIONAL MEN AND WOMEN
5750-100289-0031 HOLDING THAT THE RED MAN MUST BE ALLOWED TO WORK OUT HIS OWN SALVATION ONE OF THE EARLIEST PRACTITIONERS OF OUR RACE WAS DOCTOR SUSAN LA FLESCHE PICOTTE OF THE OMAHA TRIBE
5750-100289-0045 HE HAD UNUSUAL ELOQUENCE AND PERSONAL CHARM AND BECAME AT ONCE ONE OF BISHOP HARE'S ABLEST HELPERS IN HIS GREAT WORK AMONG THE SIOUX STATIONED AT PINE RIDGE AT THE TIME OF THE WOUNDED KNEE MASSACRE
5750-100289-0052 AT LEAST TWO ARE SUPERINTENDENTS OF SCHOOLS A NUMBER OF YOUNG WOMEN CARLISLE GRADUATES HAVE TAKEN UP TRAINED NURSING AS A PROFESSION AND ARE PRACTISING SUCCESSFULLY BOTH AMONG WHITES AND INDIANS
5750-100289-0059 WHICH ATTRACTED FAVORABLE ATTENTION AND WERE FOLLOWED BY A LITTLE VOLUME OF INDIAN LEGENDS AND SEVERAL SHORT STORIES MISSUS BONNEY HAS MORE RECENTLY WRITTEN THE BOOK OF AN INDIAN OPERA CALLED THE SUN DANCE WHICH HAS BEEN PRODUCED IN SALT LAKE CITY
5750-100289-0073 NOR ARE THEY ACCUSTOMED TO ALLOWING THE INDIAN A VOICE IN HIS OWN AFFAIRS FURTHERMORE MANY OF THE MOST PROGRESSIVE RED MEN ARE ENLISTED IN THE GOVERNMENT SERVICE WHICH WOULD MAKE THEIR POSITION A VERY DIFFICULT ONE IN CASE OF ANY FRICTION WITH THE AUTHORITIES
5750-100289-0080 AND ARTHUR C PARKER IS SECRETARY AND TREASURER THE SOCIETY OF AMERICAN INDIANS ISSUES A QUARTERLY JOURNAL DEVOTED TO THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE CONFERENCES AND THE INTERESTS OF THE INDIAN RACE
5750-100289-0087 TO PRESENT IN A JUST LIGHT THE TRUE HISTORY OF THE RACE TO PRESERVE ITS RECORDS AND EMULATE ITS DISTINGUISHING VIRTUES FOURTH TO PROMOTE CITIZENSHIP AND TO OBTAIN THE RIGHTS THEREOF FIFTH
5750-35690-0012 THE DEVIL HIMSELF WAS THE FIRST INVENTOR OF IT
5750-35690-0019 AS HE SAID OF ADRIAN MULTITUDO MEDICORUM PRINCIPEM INTERFECIT A MULTITUDE OF PHYSICIANS HATH KILLED THE EMPEROR PLUS A MEDICO QUAM A MORBO PERICULI MORE DANGER THERE IS FROM THE PHYSICIAN THAN FROM THE DISEASE
5750-35690-0026 A SECOND THE TEETH A THIRD THE HEAD
5778-12761-0007 ON THE SOUTHERN SHORE OF WHAT APPEARED TO BE THE BAY COULD BE TRACED THE GLEAMING LINE WHERE ENTERED ANOTHER LARGE STREAM AND AGAIN THE BUENAVENTURA ROSE UP IN OUR MIND
5778-12761-0014 BUT THE COLD DROVE US OUT AND MAKING A LARGE FIRE ON THE BANK AFTER WE HAD PARTIALLY DRIED OURSELVES WE WENT BACK TO MEET THE CAMP WE AFTERWARDS FOUND THAT THE GUN HAD BEEN SLUNG UNDER THE ICE WHICH LINED THE BANKS OF THE CREEK
5778-12761-0021 CONTINUING ON WE HALTED A MOMENT AT ONE OF THESE RIVULETS TO ADMIRE SOME BEAUTIFUL EVERGREEN TREES RESEMBLING LIVE OAK WHICH SHADED THE LITTLE STREAM
5778-12761-0035 WHEN HORSES DIED AND WHEN MULES AND HORSES READY TO DIE OF STARVATION WERE KILLED FOR FOOD YET THERE WAS NO MURMURING OR HESITATION IN THE MEANTIME MISTER PREUSS CONTINUED ON DOWN THE RIVER
5778-12761-0042 AND WE SAT DOWN FOR A WHILE IN THE SHADE OF THE OAKS TO LET THE ANIMALS FEED WE REPEATED OUR SHOUTS FOR MISTER PREUSS AND THIS TIME WE WERE GRATIFIED WITH AN ANSWER THE VOICE GREW RAPIDLY NEARER ASCENDING FROM THE RIVER
5778-12761-0049 SHORTLY THE ADVANCE PARTY REACHED SUTTER'S FORT WHERE THEY RECEIVED THE MOST HOSPITABLE TREATMENT
5778-54535-0013 THEY WERE NOT LONG IN GETTING ACQUAINTED WITH THE LITTLE RUSSIAN CHILDREN OR IN LEARNING THE LANGUAGE THEY WENT SKATING DRESSED IN HANDSOME FURS THEY LEARNED THE FOLK AND FANCY DANCES JOINED IN THE WINTER SPORTS AND VOTED RUSSIA A FINE COUNTRY
5778-54535-0020 THE HORSES NEXT THEIR CARRIAGE WERE FRIGHTENED AND REARED AND PLUNGED AS IF THEY WOULD HIT THE WHISTLER PARTY JAMES SHOVED HIS MOTHER DOWN ON THE SEAT BEHIND HIM AND STANDING IN FRONT OF HER BEAT THE HORSES BACK FROM THEM
5778-54535-0027 AND THE MAP DRAWING HAD GROWN SO TIRESOME THAT JAMES HAD GIVEN UP WEST POINT AND SETTLED DOWN TO PAINTING AND ETCHING IN PARIS HE HAD DECIDED THAT THERE WAS NOTHING IN THE WORLD WHICH SUITED HIM BUT THE LIFE OF AN ARTIST
5778-54535-0040 TWO FAMOUS ONES OF WHICH WE OFTEN SEE PRINTS ARE PORTRAIT OF MY MOTHER AND THE SCOTCH WRITER CARLYLE JAMES WHISTLER'S MOTHER LIVED TO BE AN OLD WOMAN AS ONE CAN GUESS FROM THE PICTURE
5778-54535-0047 YOU REMEMBER HOW MANY TIMES HE COPIED HIS OWN FOOT WHEN HE WAS A CHILD WELL HE WAS JUST AS PATIENT AND THOROUGH WHEN HE WAS OLDER FOR A LONG TIME HE MADE A PRACTICE OF DRAWING A PICTURE OF HIMSELF EVERY NIGHT BEFORE HE WENT TO BED
5789-57158-0005 SHE TALKS OF THE FIRST WEEK IN DECEMBER AND WANTS YOU TO BE THERE FOR CHRISTMAS I DON'T AT ALL KNOW THAT I CAN GO MISTER MORTON WHY NOT GO I'M AFRAID MAMMA WILL NOT SPARE ME
5789-57158-0019 TO WALK ROUND THE OLD PLACE WITH YOU THE OTHER DAY BEFORE THESE PEOPLE CAME THERE AND I WAS SO DISAPPOINTED WHEN YOU WOULD NOT COME WITH ME I WAS COMING BUT YOU WENT BACK WITH THAT OTHER MAN
5789-57158-0026 HE WAS OF COURSE ALTOGETHER UNCONSCIOUS WHAT GRAND THINGS HIS COUSIN JOHN HAD INTENDED TO DO BY HIM HAD NOT THE HONOURABLE OLD LADY INTERFERED BUT HE HAD MADE UP HIS MIND THAT DUTY REQUIRED HIM TO CALL AT THE HOUSE
5789-57158-0033 AH YES HE DIDN'T LIKE TO SAY UNCLE BECAUSE REGINALD DIDN'T LOOK OLD ENOUGH AND HE KNEW HE OUGHT NOT TO SAY BROTHER BECAUSE THE ELDER BROTHER IN ENGLAND WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE HAD THE PROPERTY I AM MISTER JOHN MORTON'S COUSIN
5789-57195-0010 WHICH WAS IN ITSELF OF ALL THINGS THE MOST PERNICIOUS IF MARY MUST GO TO CHELTENHAM WHY COULD SHE NOT GO BY HERSELF SECOND CLASS LIKE ANY OTHER YOUNG WOMAN
5789-57195-0017 THEN SHE COULD NOT REFRAIN FROM ALLUDING TO THE FACT THAT IF ANYTHING WERE TO HAPPEN TO JOHN MORTON REGINALD HIMSELF WOULD BE THE SQUIRE OF BRAGTON REGINALD WHEN HE RECEIVED THIS AT ONCE WENT OVER TO THE ATTORNEY'S HOUSE
5789-57195-0024 AND HAVING SENT IT OFF BY THE MESSENGER TRIED TO TRUST THAT THERE MIGHT YET BE GROUND FOR HOPE MISSUS MASTERS WOULD NOT HAVE ALLOWED DOLLY TO SEND SUCH A MESSAGE WITHOUT GOOD REASON
5789-70653-0000 CHAPTER SEVEN THE INQUEST THE CORONER WHO FULLY REALIZED THAT FOR THAT ONE DAY OF HIS LIFE AS A PROVINCIAL SOLICITOR HE WAS LIVING IN THE GAZE OF THE WORLD HAD RESOLVED TO BE WORTHY OF THE FLEETING EMINENCE
5789-70653-0007 WITH THE SYMPATHY WHICH EVERY MAN FELT FOR THAT DARK FIGURE OF GRIEF SHE LIFTED HER THICK VEIL BEFORE BEGINNING TO SPEAK AND THE EXTREME PALENESS AND UNBROKEN COMPOSURE OF THE LADY
5789-70653-0014 HE DID EXPLAIN WHY I REMEMBER VERY WELL WHAT HE SAID BECAUSE SHE STOPPED WITH A LITTLE APPEARANCE OF CONFUSION BECAUSE THE CORONER INSISTED GENTLY
5789-70653-0028 THE GENERAL ATTENTION WHICH FOLLOWED HER FOR A FEW MOMENTS WAS NOW EAGERLY DIRECTED UPON MARTIN WHOM THE CORONER HAD PROCEEDED TO CALL IT WAS AT THIS MOMENT THAT TRENT APPEARED AT THE DOORWAY AND EDGED HIS WAY INTO THE GREAT ROOM
5789-70653-0035 WITH A LOOK OF SINCERE GRATITUDE IN HER EYES SHE WAS MUCH BETTER NOW SHE SAID AND A CUP OF TEA WOULD WORK A MIRACLE UPON HER SHE HOPED SHE HAD NOT TAKEN HIM AWAY FROM ANYTHING IMPORTANT SHE WAS ASHAMED OF HERSELF
5808-48608-0005 BUT I SAW NOT MY MISTRESS AMONG THEM AND HE SAID O MY LORD THERE IS NONE LEFT SAVE MY MOTHER AND SISTER BUT BY ALLAH I MUST NEEDS HAVE THEM ALSO DOWN AND SHOW THEM TO THEE SO I MARVELLED AT HIS COURTESY AND LARGE HEARTEDNESS AND SAID
5808-48608-0019 SO DO THOU MARRY ME TO A FAIR WOMAN QUOTH SHE THERE IS AMONG OUR FEMALE SLAVES ONE WHO IS UNSURPASSED IN BEAUTY BUT SHE HATH A GRIEVOUS BLEMISH THE KING ASKED WHAT IS THAT AND HIS MOTHER ANSWERED
5808-48608-0026 SO THEY PRAYED TO ALMIGHTY ALLAH AND THE CHILD CAME FORTH OF THE WATER TO HER SAFE AND SOUND
5808-48608-0033 AND HE SAID TO THE JEW WILT THOU SELL ME THINE UNSALEABLE WARE FOR MINE YES ANSWERED THE JEW AND GIVING HIM THE WOODEN TRENCHER AND JAR TOOK THE FISH AND CARRIED IT HOME TO HIS FAMILY WHO SAID
5808-48608-0047 THAT QUOTH ABU HASSAN AL ZIYADI I CALLED THE PURVEYORS AND PAID THEM MY LIABILITIES AND SPENT FREELY AND AMPLY SAYING TO MYSELF BY THE TIME HE RETURNS ALLAH WILL HAVE RELIEVED ME WITH ONE OR OTHER OF THE BOUNTIES HE HATH BY HIM
5808-48608-0054 WHILST SHE FARED ON WITH ME TO THE EASTWARD OF BAGHDAD PRESENTLY AS I WENT ALONG BEHOLD
5808-54425-0000 FIVE YEARS IS BUT A SHORT TIME IN THE LIFE OF A MAN AND YET MANY THINGS MAY HAPPEN THEREIN FOR INSTANCE THE WHOLE WAY OF A FAMILY'S LIFE MAY BE CHANGED GOOD NATURES MAY BE MADE INTO BAD ONES
5808-54425-0014 NO ONE HAD EVER LOOKED AT YOU UNTIL I PICKED YOU UP AND YOU VE BEEN STRUTTING AROUND EVER SINCE

5808-54425-0041 THIS HE GULPED DOWN AND FOLLOWED WITH ANOTHER AND ANOTHER FOR A WHILE HE STOOD STILL BROODING SILENTLY HIS RED EYES BLINKING AT THE LIGHT THEN HE TURNED ABRUPTLY AND LEFT THE CLUB
5808-54425-0055 THIS WAS A TERRIBLE TERRIBLE MAN OR A MONSTER
5867-48852-0010 WHEN THE MOMENT COMES I KNOW THAT I SHALL TREMBLE BEFORE HER AND I KNOW THAT SHE'LL SEE IT
5867-48852-0017 HERE HE ENCOUNTERED HOPKINS
5867-48852-0024 EAMES PASSED ON OVER THE LITTLE BRIDGE WHICH SEEMED TO BE IN A STATE OF FAST DECAY UNATTENDED TO BY ANY FRIENDLY CARPENTER NOW THAT THE DAYS OF ITS USE WERE SO NEARLY AT AN END AND ON INTO THE GARDEN LINGERING ON THE SPOT WHERE HE HAD LAST SAID FAREWELL TO LILY
5867-48852-0038 OF COURSE NOTHING IS SETTLED IT WAS SUCH FUN SAID LILY JAMES WHO TOOK AT ANY RATE A YEAR OR TWO TO MAKE HIS PROPOSAL WANTED TO BE MARRIED THE NEXT DAY AFTERWARDS NO LILY NOT QUITE THAT WELL MAMMA IT WAS VERY NEARLY THAT
5867-48852-0045 BUT NOT THE LESS SHOULD HE HAVE IT OF RIGHT SEEING THAT HE DESIRED IT BUT YET MISSUS DALE DID NOT DARE TO GET UP AND LEAVE THE ROOM LILY HAD ASKED HER NOT TO DO SO AND AT THE PRESENT PERIOD OF THEIR LIVES ALL LILY'S REQUESTS WERE SACRED
5867-48852-0052 UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES EAMES WAS TOO HONEST A MAN NOT TO DO IT LET THE DIFFICULTIES IN HIS WAY BE WHAT THEY MIGHT HE HAD SAT THERE FOR AN HOUR AND MISSUS DALE STILL REMAINED WITH HER DAUGHTER

5867-48852-0073 SHE SPOKE IN A LOW VOICE SLOWLY ALMOST WITH DIFFICULTY BUT STILL THE WORDS CAME VERY CLEARLY WITH A CLEAR DISTINCT VOICE WHICH CAUSED THEM TO BE REMEMBERED WITH ACCURACY
5867-48852-0080 WHEN WE DO MEET LET US BE GLAD TO SEE EACH OTHER NO OTHER FRIEND SHALL EVER BE DEARER TO ME THAN YOU ARE YOU ARE SO TRUE AND HONEST WHEN YOU MARRY I WILL TELL YOUR WIFE WHAT AN INFINITE BLESSING GOD HAS GIVEN HER
5867-48852-0094 WAS IT NOT THE CASE THAT HE HAD SO FONDLY EXPECTED SUCCESS AS TO THINK ONLY OF HIS TRIUMPH IN RETURNING AND NOT OF HIS MORE PROBABLE DISGRACE HE HAD ALLOWED OTHERS TO MAKE A FOOL OF HIM
5867-48852-0101 IT WAS NOT ONLY OF HIS LATE DISAPPOINTMENT THAT HE WAS THINKING BUT OF HIS WHOLE PAST LIFE HE WAS CONSCIOUS OF HIS HOBBLEDEHOYHOOD
5867-48852-0108 WILL BE A CONSOLATION WHEN YOU ARE AS OLD AS I AM IT IS SOMETHING TO HAVE HAD A HEART
587-41611-0009 GRACE'S HEART WAS WITH HER CLASS SHE WISHED IT TO BE A CLASS AMONG CLASSES AND FELT AN ALMOST MOTHERLY ANXIETY FOR ITS SUCCESS WHAT DOES AIL SOME OF OUR CLASS SHE EXCLAIMED TO ANNE AND NORA ONE DAY AS THEY LEFT THE SCHOOL BUILDING
587-41611-0016 I SHALL TRY AWFULLY HARD FOR A PART EVEN IF IT IS ONLY TWO LINES SAID ANNE EARNESTLY I WONDER WHAT PLAY IS TO BE CHOSEN AND IF IT IS TO BE GIVEN FOR THE SCHOOL ONLY
587-41611-0023 WHO NOW THAT THE SUBJECT HAD BEEN OPENED WANTED TO HEAR MORE OF ANNE'S VIEWS OF THE STAGE UNLESS ANY GIRL HAS REMARKABLE TALENT I SHOULD ADVISE HER TO KEEP OFF THE STAGE SAID ANNE DECIDEDLY OF COURSE WHEN A GIRL COMES OF A THEATRICAL FAMILY FOR GENERATIONS
587-41619-0007 SHE HANDED THE BOOK BACK WITH AN AIR OF STUDIED INDIFFERENCE SHE WAS FAR FROM FEELING SHE HAD DECIDED IN HER OWN MIND THAT ROSALIND WAS THE PART BEST SUITED TO HER AND FELT THAT THE HONOR NOW LAY BETWEEN HERSELF AND GRACE
587-41619-0014 I WANTED HER TO PLAY ROSALIND AND I KNEW SHE COULD DO IT LOOK GIRLS MISTER SOUTHARD IS SHAKING HANDS WITH HER TRUE ENOUGH ANNE WAS SHYLY SHAKING HANDS WITH THE GREAT ACTOR WHO WAS CONGRATULATING HER WARMLY UPON HER RECENT EFFORT

587-54108-0047 EVER IN THE AFTER TIME WHEN RUTH HEARD THAT SONG SHE WAS AGAIN ROCKING IN THE FRAIL ROW BOAT UPON THE LOVELY RIVER AND A MAN'S DEEP GRAVE EYES HELD HERS AS IF THEY WOULD NEVER LET THEM GO
60-121082-0003 HE HAD NOTICED THE APPROACH OF VILLEFORT TO MADAME DANGLARS AND HE SOON GUESSED ALL THAT HAD PASSED BETWEEN THEM THOUGH THE WORDS HAD BEEN UTTERED IN SO LOW A VOICE
60-121082-0010 THEN AFTER DINNER ON THE PRETEXT OF BUSINESS HE QUESTIONED THE FATHER AND SON UPON THEIR MODE OF LIVING AND THE FATHER AND SON PREVIOUSLY INFORMED THAT IT WAS THROUGH DANGLARS THE ONE WAS TO RECEIVE HIS FORTY EIGHT THOUSAND FRANCS
60-121082-0017 IF IT WOULD NOT BE DEPRIVING HIM OF THE COMPANY OF HIS SON TO THIS CAVALCANTI REPLIED BY SAYING THAT FOR SOME TIME PAST HIS SON HAD LIVED INDEPENDENTLY OF HIM THAT HE HAD HIS OWN HORSES AND CARRIAGES

6000-55211-0060 THE GIRL WAS THE MOST STUBBORN UNREASONABLE VIXENISH LITTLE PUSS I EVER SAW I DIDN'T WANT HER OLD LOWESTOFT IF SHE DIDN'T WANT TO SELL IT BUT TO PRACTICALLY INVITE ME THERE AND THEN TREAT ME LIKE THAT SCOLDED THE COLLECTOR HIS FACE GROWING RED WITH ANGER

6019-3185-0000 THAT SERIES OF TERRIFIC EVENTS BY WHICH OUR QUIET CITY AND UNIVERSITY IN THE NORTHEASTERN QUARTER OF GERMANY WERE CONVULSED DURING THE YEAR EIGHTEEN SIXTEEN HAS IN ITSELF AND CONSIDERED MERELY AS A BLIND MOVEMENT OF HUMAN TIGER PASSION
6019-3185-0013 WHISPERINGS AT A DISTANCE CORRESPONDENCE GOING ON BETWEEN DARKNESS AND DARKNESS LIKE ONE DEEP CALLING TO ANOTHER AND THE DREAMER'S OWN HEART THE CENTER FROM WHICH THE WHOLE NETWORK OF THIS UNIMAGINABLE CHAOS RADIATES
6019-3185-0027 IT WILL BE EASILY IMAGINED THAT SUCH A STORY ALREADY ROMANTIC ENOUGH IN ITS FIRST OUTLINE WOULD LOSE NOTHING IN THE TELLING AN ENGLISHMAN TO BEGIN WITH WHICH NAME OF ITSELF AND AT ALL TIMES IS A PASSPORT INTO GERMAN FAVOR
6019-3185-0041 HAD COMMUNICATED TO HIS MANNERS A MORE THAN MILITARY FRANKNESS BUT THE PROFOUND MELANCHOLY WHICH POSSESSED HIM FROM WHATEVER CAUSE IT AROSE NECESSARILY CHILLED THE NATIVE FREEDOM OF HIS DEMEANOR
6019-3185-0048 ON THE PART OF MARGARET IT SEEMED AS IF A NEW WORLD HAD DAWNED UPON HER THAT SHE HAD NOT SO MUCH AS SUSPECTED AMONG THE CAPACITIES OF HUMAN EXPERIENCE LIKE SOME BIRD SHE SEEMED WITH POWERS UNEXERCISED FOR SOARING AND FLYING
6019-3185-0055 SHE IT WAS WHOM HE LOVED AND HAD LOVED FOR YEARS WITH THE WHOLE ARDOR OF HIS ARDENT SOUL SHE IT WAS FOR WHOM OR AT WHOSE COMMAND HE WOULD WILLINGLY HAVE DIED EARLY HE HAD FELT THAT IN HER HANDS LAY HIS DESTINY
6019-3185-0069 HANGING UPON HIS WORDS MORE LUSTROUS AND BEWITCHING THAN EVER I HAD BEHELD HER THERE SHE HAD BEEN PLACED BY THE HOST AND EVERYBODY KNEW WHY THAT IS ONE OF THE LUXURIES ATTACHED TO LOVE ALL MEN CEDE THEIR PLACES WITH PLEASURE
6019-3185-0076 MERE PANIC SEEMED TO HAVE MASTERED HER AND SHE WAS LEANING UNCONSCIOUS AND WEEPING UPON THE SHOULDER OF SOME GENTLEMAN WHO WAS ENDEAVORING TO SOOTHE HER A SILENCE OF HORROR SEEMED TO POSSESS THE COMPANY
6019-3185-0083 THAT SIGHT WAS MORE THAN COULD BE BORNE BY ONE WHO STOOD A LITTLE BEHIND THE GROUP HE RUSHED FORWARD WITH EYES GLARING LIKE A TIGER'S AND LEVELED A BLOW AT MAXIMILIAN IT WAS POOR MANIACAL VON HARRELSTEIN
6019-3185-0097 AND AS TO HIS KNOWLEDGE OF THE STATE IN WHICH THE PREMISES HAD BEEN FOUND AND HIS HAVING SO FAMILIARLY RELIED UPON THE FACT OF NO ROBBERY HAVING TAKEN PLACE AS AN ARGUMENT ON HIS OWN BEHALF
6019-3185-0104 ALL COMBINATION WITH OTHER TOWNS BEING UNAVAILING FROM THEIR GREAT DISTANCE OUR SITUATION WAS NO ORDINARY ONE HAD THERE BEEN SOME MYSTERIOUS ROBBERS AMONG US THE CHANCES OF A VISIT DIVIDED AMONG SO MANY
6019-3185-0111 AND BEING RICH BEYOND THEIR WANTS OR ANY MEANS OF EMPLOYING WEALTH WHICH THEIR GLOOMY ASCETICISM ALLOWED THEY HAD THE POWER OF DOING A GREAT DEAL OF GOOD AMONG THE INDIGENT PAPISTS OF THE SUBURBS
6064-300880-0013 THEY WON'T THANK YOU WHEN THEY MEET ACROSS THE DINNER TABLE OH IT ISN'T AS BAD AS THAT THEY'LL BE A MILE APART THE LEES WILL BE AT THE COTTAGE THEY GET OFF AT MEREDITH AND GO IN ON THE TRUCK THE WOODS I'M SENDING TO THE ISLAND

6064-56165-0002 YET WHEN HE HAD AN APPRECIATIVE AUDIENCE AND GIRLS GENERALLY APPRECIATED WHAT PHILIP SAID HE WOULD OFTEN SPEND AS MUCH AS HALF AN HOUR TALKING ABOUT THE FELLOWS
6064-56165-0009 HOW QUEER GIRLS ARE DO YOU ALWAYS FIGHT LIKE THIS WHEN YOU'RE TOGETHER WE DON'T FIGHT LIKE YOU BOYS ANSWERED EDITH GOOD HUMOREDLY WE DON'T KNOCK EACH OTHER DOWN AND RUN THE RISK OF BREAKING ONE ANOTHER'S NOSES
6064-56165-0016 SAID THE PRACTICAL EDITH I DON'T BELIEVE YOU KNOW A BIT MORE ABOUT WILL HARDON'S BRAVERY THAN YOU DID BEFORE WE KNEW SOMETHING ABOUT HIS MANNERS WHAT WHY WHEN HE SAW WHERE HE WAS HE DIDN'T RUN AWAY OR FLUNK OUT
6064-56165-0030 PHILIP HURRIED OFF BOWING IN A VERY GROWN UP WAY TO THE GROUP OF GIRLS FOR WHATEVER CRITICISMS ANY ONE MIGHT MAKE ABOUT PHILIP'S INDOLENCE AND DISINCLINATION TO STUDY NO ONE COULD DENY THAT HE HAD VERY GOOD MANNERS
6064-56168-0000 FOR A WEEK BEFORE THANKSGIVING THERE WAS GREAT EXCITEMENT AMONG THE SCHOOLGIRLS ON ACCOUNT OF THE APPROACHING FOOTBALL GAME THE FOUR WERE AS EXCITED AS THE OTHERS ALTHOUGH NOT SO MANY OF THEIR OWN PARTICULAR FRIENDS WERE IN THE HARVARD TEAM
6064-56168-0007 WHY WHO IS IT CRIED BRENDA AND WHO IS IT ECHOED BELLE I KNOW THAT YOU CAN'T GUESS OH DON'T BE SILLY NORA IT WOULDN'T BE WORTH WHILE TO GUESS ABOUT SOMETHING YOU'LL KNOW ALL ABOUT SO SOON

6064-56168-0028 SHE HAD ACQUIRED THE HABIT OF STUDYING DURING RECESS SINCE AFTER SCHOOL SHE SPENT MORE TIME THAN MOST GIRLS OF HER AGE IN OUTDOOR SPORTS IT DID HER NO GREAT HARM TO PASS THE HALF HOUR OF RECESS IN THIS WAY RUTH AS WELL AS JULIA
6078-54007-0001 FOR HE HAD A NOTION TO FIND OUT WHETHER THINGS WERE GOING ON NOWADAYS AS THEY ONE TIME DID BY AND BY HE CAME TO A CROSS ROAD AND WHO SHOULD HE SEE SITTING THERE BUT ILL LUCK HIMSELF ILL LUCK'S FACE WAS AS GRAY AS ASHES
6078-54007-0014 ALL BUILT OF WHITE MARBLE WITH A FOUNTAIN IN FRONT AND PEACOCKS STRUTTING ABOUT ON THE LAWN WELL THE FIDDLER SMOOTHED DOWN HIS HAIR AND BRUSHED HIS CLOTHES A BIT AND OFF HE WENT TO SEE WHAT WAS TO BE SEEN AT THE GRAND HOUSE AT THE END OF THE GARDEN
6078-54007-0021 EVERYTHING THE FIDDLER WANTED CAME TO HIS HAND HE LIVED HIGH AND SLEPT SOFT AND WARM AND NEVER KNEW WHAT IT WAS TO WANT EITHER MORE OR LESS OR GREAT OR SMALL IN ALL OF THOSE THREE OR FOUR DAYS HE DID NOTHING BUT ENJOY HIMSELF
6078-54007-0028 AND OUT INTO THE SUNLIGHT AGAIN IT TOOK HIM MAYBE AN HOUR TO COUNT ALL THE MONEY AND JEWELS HE HAD BROUGHT UP WITH HIM AFTER HE HAD DONE THAT HE BEGAN TO WONDER WHAT WAS INSIDE OF THE LITTLE DOOR AT THE BACK OF THE ROOM FIRST HE WONDERED
6078-54007-0042 THAT WAS A VERY FINE THING TO SAY BUT BEFORE AN HOUR HAD GONE BY THE FIDDLER'S HEAD BEGAN TO HUM AND BUZZ LIKE A BEEHIVE I DON'T BELIEVE SAID HE THERE WOULD BE A GRAIN OF HARM IN MY PEEPING INSIDE THAT DOOR ALL THE SAME
6078-54007-0049 I KNOW NOT WHY IT IS SAID HE BUT THAT STORY OF YOURS MY FRIEND BRINGS TO MY MIND A STORY OF A MAN WHOM I ONCE KNEW A GREAT MAGICIAN IN HIS TIME AND A NECROMANCER AND A CHEMIST AND AN ALCHEMIST
6078-54013-0004 SEE HERE IS A LITTLE PEBBLE AND ITS LIKE IS NOT TO BE FOUND IN THE SEVEN KINGDOMS FOR WHOEVER HOLDS IT IN HIS MOUTH CAN HEAR WHILE HE DOES SO
6078-54013-0018 THERE THE TRAVELLING COMPANION STOPPED AND DRAWING OUT A LITTLE PIPE FROM UNDER HIS JACKET
6078-54013-0025 AND STEPPING UP TO THE YOUNG MAN TOOK FROM OFF HIS FINGER A SPLENDID RUBY RING AS RED AS BLOOD AND AS BRIGHT AS FIRE AND POPPED THE SAME INTO HIS POCKET AND ALL THE WHILE THE SERVING MAN STOOD GAPING LIKE A FISH
6078-54013-0032 TREMBLING LIKE A LEAF AT WHAT HE HAD HEARD THE OLD WOMAN GAVE THEM SOME BREAD AND MEAT TO EAT AND THEN HID THEM AWAY IN THE GREAT EMPTY MEAL CHEST IN THE CORNER AND THERE THEY LAY AS STILL AS MICE

6147-34606-0013 TO GIVE BAD NEWS WHICH IS UNTRUE WHEREBY PEOPLE PUT ON MOURNING BY MISTAKE IS FUN IT WAS FUN TO CUT A SQUARE HOLE IN THE HOLBEIN AT HAMPTON COURT

6209-34599-0018 SHE OCCUPIED BOTH HIS ARMS AND TO HIM WHO WALKS OVER ICE BOTH ARMS ARE A NATURAL AND NECESSARY BALANCING POWER HE WAS OBLIGED TO DO WITHOUT THIS BALANCE HE DID WITHOUT IT AND ADVANCED
6209-34599-0032 SO FAR AS EYE COULD REACH THE HOUSE TO THE RIGHT WAS A ROOF RATHER THAN A HOUSE NOTHING COULD BE MORE MEAN THE WALLS WERE OF MUD THE ROOF WAS OF STRAW AND THERE WAS MORE THATCH THAN WALL
6209-34600-0000 ANOTHER FORM OF DESERT IT WAS WEYMOUTH WHICH HE HAD JUST ENTERED WEYMOUTH THEN WAS NOT THE RESPECTABLE AND FINE WEYMOUTH OF TO DAY ANCIENT WEYMOUTH DID NOT PRESENT LIKE THE PRESENT ONE
6209-34600-0007 BUT ALL WERE CLOSED AND DARK AT INTERVALS HE KNOCKED AT THE DOORS NO ONE ANSWERED NOTHING MAKES THE HEART SO LIKE A STONE AS BEING WARM BETWEEN SHEETS THE NOISE AND THE SHAKING HAD AT LENGTH AWAKENED THE INFANT
6209-34600-0021 AND FEELS AT EVERY MOMENT THE OBSCURE PRESSURE OF A HOSTILE ENCOUNTER WHICH IMMEDIATELY DISSOLVES THERE IS SOMETHING OF THE EFFECT OF A FOREST IN THE NOCTURNAL DIFFUSION OF DREAMS THIS IS WHAT IS CALLED BEING AFRAID WITHOUT REASON
6209-34600-0028 THE PITILESS DESERT HE HAD UNDERSTOOD THE UNRELENTING TOWN WAS TOO MUCH TO BEAR THE HOUR THE STROKES OF WHICH HE HAD JUST COUNTED HAD BEEN ANOTHER BLOW
6209-34600-0035 WHICH OF THE TWO REFUSALS SHOULD HE CHOOSE THERE IS THE ANCHOR OF MERCY THERE IS ALSO THE LOOK OF PITEOUSNESS IT WAS THAT LOOK WHICH THE POOR LITTLE DESPAIRING WANDERER THREW AROUND HIM
6209-34601-0013 SO BENUMBED ROLLED UP AND ENVELOPED IN THE JACKET THAT NOTHING COULD BE DISTINGUISHED OF HER AND SHE WAS BUT A LITTLE SHAPELESS MASS HE PASSED OVER THE THREE STEPS AND HAVING REACHED THE THRESHOLD STOPPED
6209-34601-0020 THE ONE HE HAD JUST HEARD GROWLING THE OTHER SPEAKING THE CHILD HAVING REACHED THE THRESHOLD PERCEIVED NEAR THE STOVE A MAN TALL SMOOTH THIN AND OLD DRESSED IN GRAY WHOSE HEAD AS HE STOOD
6209-34601-0027 THE MAN TOOK FROM THE SHELF A CRUST OF HARD BREAD AND AN IRON FORK AND HANDED THEM TO THE CHILD THE BOY HESITATED PERHAPS YOU EXPECT ME TO LAY THE CLOTH SAID THE MAN AND HE PLACED THE PORRINGER ON THE CHILD'S LAP
625-132112-0002 THE HARDER THE SLAVES WERE DRIVEN THE MORE CARELESS AND FATAL WAS THEIR FARMING THEN CAME THE REVOLUTION OF WAR AND EMANCIPATION THE BEWILDERMENT OF RECONSTRUCTION AND NOW WHAT IS THE EGYPT OF THE CONFEDERACY
625-132112-0009 AND THEY NOT BECAUSE THEY ARE GUILTY BUT BECAUSE THE STATE NEEDS CRIMINALS TO EKE OUT ITS INCOME BY THEIR FORCED LABOR IMMIGRANTS ARE HEIRS OF THE SLAVE BARON IN DOUGHERTY AND AS WE RIDE WESTWARD BY WIDE STRETCHING CORNFIELDS AND STUBBY ORCHARDS OF PEACH AND PEAR
625-132112-0016 BUT WHEN THE BLACK MAN DIED LAST FALL THE MASTER'S SONS IMMEDIATELY LAID CLAIM TO THE ESTATE AND THEM WHITE FOLKS WILL GET IT TOO SAID MY YELLOW GOSSIP I TURN FROM THESE WELL TENDED ACRES WITH A COMFORTABLE FEELING THAT THE NEGRO IS RISING
625-132112-0030 AND THEN HE SAID SLOWLY LET A WHITE MAN TOUCH ME AND HE DIES I DON'T BOAST THIS I DON'T SAY IT AROUND LOUD OR BEFORE THE CHILDREN BUT I MEAN IT
625-132112-0037 BUT A WHITE MAN LOANED ME ANOTHER THEN HE ADDED EYEING US
625-132112-0044 WELCOME QUITE A CONTRAST TO THE SOUTHWESTERN PART OF DOUGHERTY COUNTY IS THE NORTHWEST SOBERLY TIMBERED IN OAK AND PINE IT HAS NONE OF THAT HALF TROPICAL LUXURIANCE OF THE SOUTHWEST
625-132112-0058 MATRONLY PREACHER'S WIFE PLUMP YELLOW AND INTELLIGENT OWN LAND SAID THE WIFE WELL ONLY THIS HOUSE THEN SHE ADDED QUIETLY WE DID BUY SEVEN HUNDRED ACRES ACROSS UP YONDER AND PAID FOR IT BUT THEY CHEATED US OUT OF IT
625-132118-0006 HAD OFFERED ITSELF TO WIN A LIFE AND WON WHAT IS THIS TINY FORMLESS THING THIS NEWBORN WAIL FROM AN UNKNOWN WORLD ALL HEAD AND VOICE
625-132118-0013 AND SEEING WITH THOSE BRIGHT WONDERING EYES THAT PEER INTO MY SOUL A LAND WHOSE FREEDOM IS TO US A MOCKERY AND WHOSE LIBERTY A LIE
625-132118-0026 IS NOT THIS MY LIFE HARD ENOUGH IS NOT THAT DULL LAND THAT STRETCHES ITS SNEERING WEB ABOUT ME COLD ENOUGH IS NOT ALL THE WORLD BEYOND THESE FOUR LITTLE WALLS PITILESS ENOUGH BUT THAT THOU MUST NEEDS ENTER HERE THOU O DEATH
625-132118-0040 BEFORE THE WORLD HAD DUBBED YOUR AMBITION INSOLENCE HAD HELD YOUR IDEALS UNATTAINABLE AND TAUGHT YOU TO CRINGE AND BOW
6272-70168-0003 AND NOT OFFERING TO APPROACH ME YOUR HAIR IS AS THICK AS A MOP HEPSEY RUBBING HER FINGERS AGAINST HER THUMB REMARKED THAT SHE HOPED LEARNING HAD NOT TAKEN AWAY MY APPETITE
6272-70168-0010 BECAUSE YOU HAVE HAD THE BLESSING OF SO GOOD A MAN AS YOUR GRAND'THER BUT I NEVER HEARD A WORD OF GRAND'THER'S PRAYERS DO YOU REMEMBER HIS VOICE
6272-70168-0017 I GREW BLITHE AS I SAW IT WINKING UNDER THE RAYS OF THE AFTERNOON SUN AND CLAPPING MY HANDS SAID I WAS GLAD TO GET HOME WE LEFT VERONICA AT THE TABLE AND MOTHER RESUMED HER CONVERSATION WITH ME IN A CORNER OF THE ROOM
6272-70168-0031 THOUGH THE FIRE HAD GONE OUT THE LAMPS WINKED BRIGHTLY AND FATHER MOVING HIS CIGAR TO THE OTHER SIDE OF HIS MOUTH CHANGED HIS REGARDS FROM ONE LAMP TO THE OTHER AND SAID HE THOUGHT I WAS GROWING TO BE AN ATTRACTIVE GIRL
6272-70171-0003 ROSVILLE WAS LARGER AND HANDSOMER THAN SURREY THAT IS MY HOUSE ON THE RIGHT HE SAID WE LOOKED DOWN THE SHADY STREET THROUGH WHICH WE WERE GOING
6272-70171-0010 I FELT CONSTRAINED TO END MY REPAST HE ROSE THEN AND PUSHING BACK FOLDING DOORS WE ENTERED A LARGE ROOM LEAVING ALICE AT THE TABLE WINDOWS EXTENDING TO THE FLOOR OPENING ON THE PIAZZA
6272-70171-0024 I DREW FROM HER CONVERSATION THE OPINION THAT SHE HAD A TENDENCY TO THE REARING OF CHILDREN I WAS GLAD WHEN COUSIN CHARLES CAME IN LOOKING AT HIS WATCH SEND OFF THE BABIES ALICE AND RING THE BELL FOR BREAKFAST SHE SENT OUT THE TWO YOUNGEST
6272-70171-0031 SHE SAID SHE WAS AFRAID TO GO THEY LOOKED UNGOVERNABLE BUT HE REASSURED HER AND ONE OF THE MEN AVERRING THAT MISTER MORGESON COULD DRIVE ANYTHING SHE REPRESSED HER FEARS AND WE DROVE OUT OF THE YARD BEHIND A PAIR OF HORSES
6272-70171-0038 AND WE FOLLOWED HIM TO HER SCHOOL ROOM I WAS AT ONCE INTERESTED AND IMPRESSED BY THE APPEARANCE OF MY TEACHER THAT WAS TO BE SHE WAS A DIGNIFIED KIND LOOKING WOMAN WHO ASKED ME A FEW QUESTIONS IN SUCH A PLEASANT DIRECT MANNER
6272-70191-0010 BECAUSE HE LOOKED SO GRIEF STRUCK AUNT MERCE WAS ENGAGED WITH A DRESSMAKER AND WITH THE ORDERS FOR BONNETS AND VEILS SHE DISCUSSED THE SUBJECT OF THE MOURNING WITH THE MORGESONS I ACQUIESCED IN ALL HER ARRANGEMENTS
6272-70191-0017 IT WAS CLOSELY PRESSED TO THE GLASS AND SHE WAS REGARDING DARK INDEFINITE CREATURES BELOW IT
6272-70191-0024 PUT HER HAND ON AN EMPTY CHAIR BESIDE FATHER WHO SAT BY THE COFFIN THOSE PASSAGES IN THE BIBLE WHICH CONTAIN THE BEAUTIFULLY POETIC IMAGES RELATING TO THE GOING OF MAN TO HIS LONG HOME WERE READ AND TO MY EAR
6367-65536-0000 THE MAN HALTED ON THE CREST OF THE HILL AND LOOKED SOMBRELY DOWN INTO THE LONG VALLEY BELOW IT WAS EVENING AND ALTHOUGH THE HILLS AROUND HIM WERE STILL IN THE LIGHT THE VALLEY WAS ALREADY FILLED WITH KINDLY PLACID SHADOWS
6367-65536-0007 A FACE THAT HID MUCH AND REVEALED LITTLE IT TOLD OF POWER AND INTELLECT BUT THE SOUL OF THE MAN WAS A HIDDEN THING
6367-65536-0014 WERE THEY YET TO BE HAD FOR THE SEEKING IN THE OLD VALLEY WITH THE THOUGHT CAME A GREAT YEARNING FOR HOME HE HAD HAD MANY HABITATIONS BUT HE REALIZED NOW THAT HE HAD NEVER THOUGHT OF ANY OF THESE PLACES AS HOME
6367-65536-0028 HE WANTED TO GO BEYOND THE HILLS AND SEEK WHAT HE KNEW MUST BE THERE THE VALLEY WAS TOO NARROW TOO PLACID HE LONGED FOR CONFLICT AND ACCOMPLISHMENT
6367-65536-0035 HOW TRUE AND STRONG AND WOMANLY AND GENTLE SHE HAD ALWAYS BEEN WHEN HE LEFT HOME HE HAD MEANT TO GO BACK TO HER SOME DAY THEY HAD PARTED WITHOUT PLEDGE OR KISS YET HE KNEW SHE LOVED HIM AND THAT HE LOVED HER
6367-65536-0042 SUDDENLY GLANCING OVER HIS SHOULDER HE SAW THROUGH AN ARCH OF BLACK FIR BOUGHS A YOUNG MOON SWUNG LOW IN A LAKE OF PALELY TINTED SAFFRON SKY HE SMILED A LITTLE
6367-65536-0056 BUT HE TOOK BOTH AND HELD HER SO LOOKING HUNGRILY DOWN AT HER AS A MAN LOOKS AT SOMETHING HE KNOWS MUST BE HIS SALVATION IF SALVATION EXISTS FOR HIM IS IT POSSIBLE YOU ARE HERE STILL JOYCE
6367-65536-0063 AS THE WORLD CALLS SUCCESS HE ANSWERED BITTERLY I HAVE PLACE AND WEALTH AND POWER BUT THAT IS NOT SUCCESS JOYCE I AM TIRED OF THESE THINGS THEY ARE THE TOYS OF GROWN UP CHILDREN
6367-65536-0070 LIFE EVEN IN THE GLARE AND TUMULT OF THAT WORLD BEYOND THE HILLS WOULD NEVER HAVE LOST ITS MEANING FOR HIM OH FOOL AND BLIND THAT HE HAD BEEN WHILE HE HAD SOUGHT AND TOILED AFAR
6367-74004-0008 SHE WASN'T A CAD GIRL OF COURSE SHE WAS OVER TWENTY AND HAD GRADUATED FROM IT TWO YEARS AGO BUT SHE WAS IN ALL THE SOCIAL THINGS THAT WENT ON IN THE ACADEMY AND ALL THE UNMARRIED PROFESSORS EXCEPT THE OLD FELLOW WERE IN LOVE WITH HER
6367-74004-0015 LET'S WRITE A LETTER TO SYLVIA GRANT A LOVE LETTER AND SIGN THE OLD FELLOW'S NAME TO IT SHE'LL GIVE HIM A FEARFUL SNUBBING AND WE'LL BE REVENGED BUT WHO'LL WRITE IT I SAID DOUBTFULLY I CAN'T
6367-74004-0022 AND HE WOUND UP BY IMPLORING HER TO TELL HIM IF SHE COULD POSSIBLY LOVE HIM A LITTLE BIT AND ALL THAT SORT OF THING I COPIED THE LETTER OUT ON HELIOTROPE PAPER IN MY BEST IMITATION OF THE OLD FELLOW'S HANDWRITING AND SIGNED IT YOURS DEVOTEDLY AND IMPLORINGLY
6367-74004-0036 THERE THEY BOTH WERE GOING ON AT THE SILLIEST RATE ABOUT HOW MUCH THEY LOVED EACH OTHER AND HOW THE OLD FELLOW THOUGHT SHE LOVED MICKY AND ALL THAT SORT OF THING IT WAS AWFUL I NEVER THOUGHT THE OLD FELLOW OR SYLVIA EITHER COULD BE SO SPOONEY
6385-220959-0005 ON THE CONTRARY THEY ARE INTELLECTUAL REALITIES SO LOVE IS A MENTAL REALITY AND NOT SENSIBLE FOR THIS REALITY THE EAR DOES NOT HEAR THE EYE DOES NOT SEE THE SMELL DOES NOT PERCEIVE
6385-220959-0012 BUT TO EXPLAIN THEM YOU ARE OBLIGED TO HAVE RECOURSE TO SENSIBLE FIGURES BECAUSE IN THE EXTERIOR WORLD THERE IS NOTHING THAT IS NOT SENSIBLE SO THE SYMBOL OF KNOWLEDGE IS LIGHT AND OF IGNORANCE DARKNESS BUT REFLECT
6385-220959-0026 AND OF EVERYTHING HAVE WE CREATED TWO KINDS THAT IS TO SAY WE HAVE CREATED ALL THE BEINGS THROUGH PAIRING BRIEFLY THEY SAY A MAN WITHOUT A HUMAN FATHER CANNOT BE IMAGINED
6385-220959-0033 IF YOU SAY THAT THIS LAMP HAS ONCE BEEN LIGHTED WITHOUT WICK AND OIL AND THEN SAY THAT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO LIGHT IT WITHOUT THE WICK THIS IS ILLOGICAL CHRIST HAD A MOTHER THE FIRST MAN AS THE MATERIALISTS BELIEVE
6385-220959-0040 AND BREATHED INTO HIS NOSTRILS THE BREATH OF LIFE
6385-34655-0010 PERHAPS THE ARCHITECTS OF THE LITTLE ROOMS BUILDING FOR ROYALTY AND ARISTOCRACY TOOK AS MODELS THE RAMIFICATIONS OF CORAL BEDS AND THE OPENINGS IN A SPONGE THE BRANCHES BECAME A LABYRINTH PICTURES
6385-34655-0017 AT TIMES HE THOUGHT THAT HE MUST BE RETURNING TOWARDS HIS STARTING POINT THEN THAT HE SAW SOME ONE APPROACHING IT WAS NO ONE IT WAS ONLY THE REFLECTION OF HIMSELF IN A MIRROR DRESSED AS A NOBLEMAN THAT HE IMPOSSIBLE
6385-34655-0024 EVERYWHERE WAS MAGNIFICENCE AT ONCE REFINED AND STUPENDOUS IF IT WAS NOT THE MOST DIMINUTIVE OF PALACES IT WAS THE MOST GIGANTIC OF JEWEL CASES A HOUSE FOR MAB OR A JEWEL FOR GEO
6385-34669-0002 OR AT LEAST THE LIGHT WHICH LEADS TO IT REGAINED THE SUDDEN INTERVENTION OF SOME MYSTERIOUS CLEMENCY POSSESSED PERHAPS BY DESTINY LIFE SAYING BEHOLD ME IN THE DARKEST RECESS OF THE GRAVE
6385-34669-0009 WHICH WE HAVE HELD TO HAVE COME FROM BELOW HAS IN REALITY COME FROM ABOVE WHO KNOWS ALL THE MYSTERIOUS FORMS ASSUMED BY GOD WHAT WAS THIS ANIMAL PROVIDENCE HAVING REACHED THE RIVER
6385-34669-0016 BOTH FLAPS OF THE GANGWAY WERE LOWERED ON THE RIGHT AND LEFT ON HINGES THUS MAKING A ROOF OVER THE HOLD SO THAT THE SHIP IN HEAVY SEAS WAS HERMETICALLY CLOSED THESE SLOOPS BEING OF VERY MASSIVE CONSTRUCTION HAD A BEAM FOR A TILLER
6385-34669-0030 DOES IT NOT SEEM THAT THE LAW AND THE WILL OF NATURE WOULD HAVE DICTATED GWYNPLAINE'S HEADLONG RUSH TO THROW HIMSELF UPON LIFE HAPPINESS LOVE REGAINED SO THEY WOULD
6415-100596-0004 THE FRESHMEN ARE SIMPLY SCRAMBLING TO GET IN THEY'RE TRYING TO SHOW FRAEULEIN SCHERIN HOW MUCH INTEREST THEY TAKE IN THE SUBJECT GEORGIE LAUGHED PATTY PICKED UP THE PENCIL WOULD YOU LIKE TO JOIN
6415-100596-0011 SEVERAL WEEKS LATER PRISCILLA WAS ENGAGED IN LABORIOUSLY TURNING THE MINUTES OF THE LAST MEETING INTO GRAMMATICAL GERMAN AND AS SHE CLOSED THE DICTIONARY AND GRAMMAR WITH A SIGH OF RELIEF SHE REMARKED TO PATTY DO YOU KNOW
6415-100596-0025 WERE REENTERTAINING ONE OR TWO FRIENDS ON THE LETTUCE SANDWICHES AND CAKES THE OBLIGING GUESTS HAD FAILED TO CONSUME THE COMPANY AND THE CLOTHES HAVING PASSED IN REVIEW THE CONVERSATION FLAGGED A LITTLE AND GEORGIE SUDDENLY ASKED
6415-100596-0032 I'M AFRAID SO SIGHED PATTY IT'S BEEN VERY ENTERTAINING BUT SHE IS REALLY GETTING SENSITIVE ON THE SUBJECT AND I DON'T DARE MENTION KATE FERRIS'S NAME WHEN WE'RE ALONE
6415-111615-0003 BROODING AT THE SLUTTISH TYPEWRITER HE REMEMBERS THE FLUSH OF SHAME THAT TINGLED HIM AS HE WALKED SADLY HOMEWARD THINKING OF SOME ATROCIOUS INANITY HE HAD SENT UPSTAIRS TO THE COMPOSING ROOM IT IS A JOB THAT ENGENDERS A HEALTHY HUMILITY
6415-111615-0017 YET NOW AND THEN HE GETS A GLIMPSE INTO A HUMAN VEXATION SO SINCERE SO HONEST AND SO MOVING THAT HE TURNS AWAY FROM THE TYPEWRITER WITH A SIGH HE WONDERS HOW ONE DARE APPROACH THE CHRONICLING OF THIS MUDDLED PANORAMA
6415-111615-0024 WHO WAS STANDING ON CHESTNUT STREET STUDYING A POCKET NOTEBOOK HIS UMBRELLA LEANED AGAINST A SHOP WINDOW ON THE SILL OF WHICH HE HAD LAID A CAREFULLY ROLLED UP NEWSPAPER BY HIS FEET WAS A NEAT LEATHER BRIEF CASE PLUMPLY FILLED WITH CONTENTS NOT DISCERNIBLE
6415-111615-0031 DARE ONE SAY BEAUTY AND PHRASE THEM INTELLIGIBLY BUT IT IS FUN ONE NEVER BUYS A PACKAGE OF TOBACCO CROSSES A CITY SQUARE ENTERS A TROLLEY CAR OR STUDIES A SHOP WINDOW WITHOUT TRYING IN A BAFFLED HOPELESS WAY
6415-116629-0004 NO ONE EVER KNOWS HOW TO TAKE YOU GRUMBLED BLASI IT WOULDN'T HELP YOU TO TAKE ME IF YOU DID NOT TAKE YOUR HANDS OUT TOO SAID JUDITH BUT NEVER MIND I HAVE REALLY SOMETHING GOOD FOR YOU AND JUDITH MOTIONED TO HIM TO COME NEARER
6415-116629-0018 AND MUTTERED I WONDER IF SHE WANTS TO GET HIM TOO
6415-116629-0032 SHE SAID TO HERSELF AND SHE FOLDED HER HANDS IN PRAYER FOR HER HABIT WAS TO LAY ALL HER TROUBLES BEFORE GOD HER SUPPORTER AND COMFORTER AT THIS MOMENT SHE HEARD THROUGH THE STILLNESS LOUD SHOUTS AND CRIES FIRST AT A DISTANCE
6415-116629-0039 AS SHE HAD LISTENED THROUGH ALL THE LONG NIGHT IN VAIN DIETRICH HAD NOT COME HOME IN THE NIGHT
6437-66172-0006 THAT I HAD MY CURIOSITY ROUSED TO THE HIGHEST PITCH BY A SIGHT OF THESE SINGULAR EMBLEMS AS SOON AS I ASCERTAINED THE EXISTENCE OF A BOYS CLUB OF COURSE I WAS READY TO DIE TO JOIN IT AND EVENTUALLY I WAS ALLOWED TO JOIN
6437-66172-0020 IF HE SHOWED THE SLIGHTEST TERROR HE WAS CERTAIN TO BE TRICKED UNMERCIFULLY ONE OF OUR SUBSEQUENT DEVICES A HUMBLE INVENTION OF MY OWN WAS TO REQUEST THE BLINDFOLDED CANDIDATE TO PUT OUT HIS TONGUE WHEREUPON THE FIRST CENTIPEDE WOULD SAY
6437-66172-0027 ABOUT A WEEK AFTER MY ADMISSION INTO THE SECRET ORDER THE QUIET CITIZENS AWOKE TO FIND THAT THE SIGNBOARDS OF ALL THE PRINCIPAL STREETS HAD CHANGED PLACES DURING THE NIGHT PEOPLE WHO WENT TRUSTFULLY TO SLEEP IN CURRANT SQUARE OPENED THEIR EYES IN HONEYSUCKLE TERRACE
6437-66172-0034 IT WAS UNANIMOUSLY RESOLVED THAT CONWAY'S ANIMOSITY SHOULD NOT BE QUIETLY SUBMITTED TO HE HAD SOUGHT TO INFORM AGAINST US IN THE STAGECOACH BUSINESS HE HAD VOLUNTEERED TO CARRY PETTINGIL'S LITTLE BILL FOR TWENTY FOUR ICECREAMS TO CHARLEY MARDEN'S FATHER
6437-66173-0003 HE PERFORMED THE FEAT UNCONSCIOUSLY THROUGHOUT THIS ENTIRE MORNING HIS THUMBS WERE OBSERVED TO BE IN A CHRONIC STATE OF DISLOCATION INDICATING GREAT MENTAL AGITATION ON THE PART OF THE OWNER WE FULLY EXPECTED AN OUTBREAK FROM HIM AT RECESS
6437-66173-0010 AND KEEPING MY EYE FIXED STEADILY ON CONWAY'S IN ALL OF WHICH I WAS FAITHFULLY FOLLOWING THE INSTRUCTIONS OF PHIL ADAMS WHOSE FATHER SUBSCRIBED TO A SPORTING JOURNAL CONWAY ALSO THREW HIMSELF INTO A DEFENSIVE ATTITUDE
6437-66173-0017 BUT I WAS GOING TO BECAUSE HE KNOWS WHO PUT MEEKS'S MORTAR OVER OUR DOOR AND I KNOW WELL ENOUGH WHO DID IT IT WAS THAT SNEAKING LITTLE MULATTER POINTING AT ME O BY GEORGE I CRIED REDDENING AT THE INSULT
6437-66173-0031 IT'S QUITE RIGHT AND JUSTIFIABLE IF DONE FROM A SIMPLE AVERSION TO PHYSICAL PAIN AND DANGER BUT DON'T SAY NO BECAUSE YOU FEAR A LICKING AND SAY OR THINK IT'S BECAUSE YOU FEAR GOD FOR THAT'S NEITHER CHRISTIAN NOR HONEST AND IF YOU DO FIGHT
6437-66173-0038 I COULDN'T HELP SAYING TO MYSELF IF THIS IS VICTORY HOW ABOUT THAT OTHER FELLOW TOM SAID HARRY BLAKE HESITATING WELL

6454-107462-0010 INCRIMINATING FACTS OR CERTAIN LETTERS HE WOULD RING THE CHANGES ON THESE THREE ACCORDING TO THE SEX AND TEMPERAMENT WITH WHICH HE HAD TO DEAL
6454-107462-0024 THERE WAS ONE OF THIS NATURE WHICH TROUBLED HIS REST LONG WELL THE WAY OF IT WAS YOU SEE HE PUT IT UP THE CHIMBLEY BUT WHEN THE CHIMBLEY SWEEPERS COME HE TRANSFERRED IT IN HIS WESKIT

6454-120342-0028 LARGE ENOUGH TO CONTAIN ALL THE GOOD WISHES SO AWAY AGAIN TO THE HOUSES OF CONFECTIONERS WHO HAD GIVEN THE CHILDREN CANDY

6454-93938-0012 THE THREE CONSPIRATORS JUMPED TO THEIR FEET AND BOLTED FOR THE WINDOW
6454-93938-0019 BUT I LOST SIGHT OF THEM THE NEXT MOMENT AS SOON AS I REACHED A STREET LEADING BACK TO THE RAILROAD I TURNED AGAIN AND RODE TOWARDS IT MY ONE THOUGHT BEING TO GET BACK IF POSSIBLE TO THE STATION
6454-93938-0033 AFRAID TO SHOUT ANYTHING WHICH SHOULD CONVEY THE SLIGHTEST CLUE AS TO THE WHEREABOUTS OF THE LETTERS AS THE NEXT BEST THING I PULLED A COUPLE OF OLD SECTION REPORTS FROM MY POCKET
6476-57446-0004 I AM LIVING IN A POOR AND HUMBLE HOUSE BUT IF YOUR LORDSHIP AT YOUR LEISURE WOULD HONOUR ME WITH A VISIT WELL IT'S A LUCKY CHANCE THAT HAS BROUGHT US TOGETHER AND I CERTAINLY WILL GO AND SEE YOU BESIDES I WANT YOU TO DO SOMETHING FOR ME
6476-57446-0011 HOW HE HAD FIRST MET HER AND FALLEN IN LOVE WITH HER AT THE ADZUMA BRIDGE HOW CHOKICHI HAD INTRODUCED HER TO HIM AT THE TEA HOUSE AT OJI AND THEN WHEN SHE FELL ILL AND HE WANTED TO SEE HER AGAIN INSTEAD OF BRINGING HER TO HIM HAD ONLY GIVEN HIM GOOD ADVICE

6476-57446-0067 CONFESSED THAT HE HAD HIDDEN O KOYO AT GENZABURO'S INSTIGATION AND THEN KILLED CHOKICHI WHO HAD FOUND OUT THE SECRET UPON THIS THE GOVERNOR AFTER CONSULTING ABOUT GENZABURO'S CASE DECIDED THAT
6476-57446-0081 TO THE DELIGHT OF HER PARENTS WHO REJOICED THAT THEIR DAUGHTER SHOULD BEAR SEED TO A NOBLEMAN BUT SHE SOON FELL SICK AND DIED AND THE OLD PEOPLE TOOK CHARGE OF THE BABE AND WHEN THEY ALSO DIED THE CARE OF THE CHILD FELL TO HIS MOTHER'S KINSMEN
6476-96661-0000 AND THEIR MOTHER WAS LEDA WHO AFTER THE TWIN BROTHERS HAD ANOTHER CHILD BORN TO HER HELEN FOR WHOSE SAKE THE SONS OF MANY OF JASON'S FRIENDS WERE TO WAGE WAR AGAINST THE GREAT CITY OF TROY

6476-96661-0021 VERY GRAVE AND WISE LOOKED ARGUS ARGUS THE BUILDER OF THE SHIP AND WONDERFUL TO THE HEROES THE SHIP LOOKED NOW THAT ARGUS FOR THEIR VIEWING HAD SET UP THE MAST WITH THE SAILS AND HAD EVEN PUT THE OARS IN THEIR PLACES
6476-96661-0028 THERE WERE MEN FIGHTING AND WOMEN WATCHING FROM HIGH TOWERS THE AWFUL FIGURE OF THE DARKNESS OF DEATH WAS SHOWN THERE TOO WITH MOURNFUL EYES AND THE DUST OF BATTLES UPON HER SHOULDERS THE OUTER RIM OF THE SHIELD
6529-62554-0005 AND ARE OF SUCH A NATURE THAT ONLY A MAN POSSESSED OF PRODIGIOUS POWER COULD RENDER THEM AYRTON IS INDEBTED TO HIM AS MUCH AS WE ARE FOR IF IT WAS THE STRANGER WHO SAVED ME FROM THE WAVES AFTER THE FALL FROM THE BALLOON

6529-62554-0033 THE INITIAL VELOCITY IS IN PROPORTION TO THE QUANTITY OF POWDER USED IN THE FABRICATION OF THESE PIECES EVERYTHING DEPENDS ON EMPLOYING A METAL WITH THE HIGHEST POSSIBLE POWER OF RESISTANCE AND STEEL IS INCONTESTABLY THAT METAL OF ALL OTHERS WHICH RESISTS THE BEST
6529-62554-0047 HIS ROUGH NATURE COULD NOT ALLOW THAT THEY OUGHT TO COME TO TERMS WITH THE RASCALS WHO HAD LANDED ON THE ISLAND WITH BOB HARVEY'S ACCOMPLICES THE MURDERERS OF THE CREW OF THE SPEEDY AND HE LOOKED UPON THEM AS WILD BEASTS WHICH OUGHT TO BE DESTROYED WITHOUT DELAY AND WITHOUT REMORSE
6529-62554-0054 AFTER ALL THE ISLAND WAS LARGE AND FERTILE IF ANY SENTIMENT OF HONESTY YET REMAINED IN THE BOTTOM OF THEIR HEARTS THESE WRETCHES MIGHT PERHAPS BE RECLAIMED WAS IT NOT THEIR INTEREST IN THE SITUATION IN WHICH THEY FOUND THEMSELVES TO BEGIN A NEW LIFE
6529-62556-0004 ON SEEING HERBERT SENSELESS THE SAILOR'S GRIEF WAS TERRIBLE HE SOBBED HE CRIED HE TRIED TO BEAT HIS HEAD AGAINST THE WALL NEITHER THE ENGINEER NOR THE REPORTER COULD CALM HIM

6531-61334-0030 HE WAS SO GREATLY FEARED BY THE SYRO CAPPADOCIAN HITTITES THAT WHEN HE APPROACHED THEIR TERRITORY THEY SENT HIM TRIBUTE YIELDING WITHOUT A STRUGGLE
6531-61334-0037 REIGNED FOR ABOUT A QUARTER OF A CENTURY
6531-61334-0051 THE ASSYRIAN SCULPTURES OF THIS PERIOD LACK THE TECHNICAL SKILL THE DELICACY AND IMAGINATION OF SUMERIAN AND AKKADIAN ART BUT THEY ARE FULL OF ENERGY DIGNIFIED AND MASSIVE AND STRONG AND LIFELIKE
6531-61334-0058 AND HIS PEOPLE SLEW THEM WITH A GREAT SLAUGHTER SO THERE FELL DOWN SLAIN IN ISRAEL FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND CHOSEN MEN THUS THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL WERE BROUGHT UNDER AT THAT TIME AND THE CHILDREN OF JUDAH PREVAILED BECAUSE THEY RELIED UPON THE LORD GOD OF THEIR FATHERS
6531-61334-0065 AND APPARENTLY SUPPORTED THE REBELLIONS OF THE NORTHERN MESOPOTAMIAN KINGS
6531-61334-0079 IT WAS OF NO GREAT ADVANTAGE TO HIM FOR HE WAS UNABLE TO FOLLOW IT UP
6531-61334-0086 OF THAT KINGDOM AND WAS THUS ABLE TO OPERATE IN THE NORTH WEST WITHOUT FEAR OF COMPLICATIONS WITH THE RIVAL CLAIMANT OF MESOPOTAMIA
6531-61334-0093 A ROYAL PRINCESS OF ISRAEL WAS DEAD
6531-61334-0107 OF THE IDOLATORS OF THE ANCIENT CULT OF THE QUEEN OF HEAVEN THE CROWN OF JUDAH HAD BEEN SEIZED BY THE ISRAELITISH QUEEN MOTHER
6531-61334-0114 AND WHEN SHE WAS COME TO THE ENTERING OF THE HORSE GATE BY THE KING'S HOUSE THEY SLEW HER THERE AND JEHOIADA MADE A COVENANT BETWEEN HIM AND BETWEEN ALL THE PEOPLE
6531-61334-0121 ARBELA IMGURBEL AND DUR BALAT AS WELL AS SOME OF THE DEPENDENCIES SHALMANESER RETAINED KALKHI AND THE PROVINCES OF NORTHERN MESOPOTAMIA AND IT APPEARS THAT THE GREATER PART OF THE ARMY ALSO REMAINED LOYAL TO HIM
6563-285357-0002 WAS EXPENDED BEFORE THE SHIP COULD TAKE TO THE AIR A FURTHER CRASH AND BLASTING OF CHERISHED HOPES APPEARED IMMINENT BUT AT THIS MOMENT ANOTHER ROYAL PERSONAGE CAME TO THE INVENTOR'S AID THE KING OF WURTEMBERG
6563-285357-0009 BUT INCONCLUSIVE ONE OF THE MOTORS WENT WRONG AND THE LONGITUDINAL STABILITY WAS FOUND TO BE INDIFFERENT THE VESSEL WAS BROUGHT DOWN AND WAS TO BE ANCHORED BUT THE FATES RULED OTHERWISE A STRONG WIND CAUGHT HER DURING THE NIGHT
6563-285357-0016 TO THOSE IMPOSED FOR THE GOVERNMENT TEST ON JUNE TWENTIETH NINETEEN O EIGHT AT EIGHT TWENTY SIX A M THE CRAFT ASCENDED AND REMAINED ALOFT FOR TWELVE HOURS DURING WHICH TIME IT MADE AN ENCOURAGING CIRCULAR TOUR FLUSHED WITH THIS SUCCESS
6563-285357-0030 BUT WHEN ONE REFLECTS AT THIS MOMENT UPON THE ACHIEVEMENTS OF THIS AIRCRAFT DURING THE PRESENT CONFLAGRATION THE UNPREJUDICED WILL BE RATHER INCLINED TO HAZARD THE OPINION THAT IMPERIAL TEUTON PRAISE IS A SYNONYM FOR DAMNATION
6563-285357-0037 PROVED VERY CONVINCINGLY BUT THE ZEPPELIN MUST NOT BE UNDER RATED MAGNIFICENT PERFORMANCES HAVE BEEN RECORDED BY THESE VESSELS SUCH AS THE ROUND ONE THOUSAND MILES TRIP IN NINETEEN O NINE AND SEVERAL OTHER
6563-285357-0044 ALL OF WHICH HAVE PROVED THEIR SERVICEABILITY MORE OR LESS CONCLUSIVELY
6563-63821-0012 HE WOULD SHOW YOU A COLLECTION OF MORE THAN THIRTY NINE THOUSAND PAMPHLETS OF WHICH EIGHT THOUSAND WERE PRINTED BEFORE THE YEAR EIGHTEEN HUNDRED HIS COLLECTION OF MAPS RELATING TO AMERICA WAS TRULY WONDERFUL BESIDES ALL THE EARLY ATLASES OF ANY NOTE
6563-63821-0019 AND THAT HE TRAVELED FAR AND WIDE IN SEARCH OF THESE PRECIOUS OBJECTS NOT AT ALL HE NEVER WAS A RICH MAN AND I BELIEVE HE RARELY TRAVELED BEYOND THE SIGHT OF THE DOME OF THE CAPITOL INDEED THE MOST WONDERFUL THING ABOUT HIS COLLECTION WAS THAT HE
6563-63821-0026 AND WALKED TEN MILES IN THE FACE OF A NORTHEASTERLY STORM TO GET A RARE PAMPHLET OF FOUR PAGES HE WAS A MISER OF SUCH THINGS BUT NO THAT WORD DOES NOT DESCRIBE HIM FOR ONE OF THE GREATEST PLEASURES OF HIS LIFE
6563-63821-0040 I DON'T BELIEVE IN YOUR WORK SIR SAID THE SECRETARY IT IS OF NO USE TO ANYBODY I NEVER READ A PAGE OF IT AND NEVER EXPECT TO BUT SAID MISTER FORCE THE WORK IS PUBLISHED IN VIRTUE OF A CONTRACT WITH THE GOVERNMENT

669-129061-0035 PITT STOOPED AND PICKED THEM UP AMAZED AT SO MUCH WEALTH NOT THAT RAWDON SAID I HOPE TO PUT A BULLET INTO THE MAN WHOM THAT BELONGS TO
669-129061-0049 HAD HE BEEN LOOKING OUT TROOPS OF SCHOOLS WERE ON THEIR MARCH TO CHURCH

669-129074-0005 SHE PICKETED HER STEED HUNG UP HER WEAPONS AND WARMED HERSELF COMFORTABLY BY HIS FIRE THE HALT IN THAT ROVING RESTLESS LIFE WAS INEXPRESSIBLY SOOTHING AND PLEASANT TO HER

6818-68772-0001 FORBES FOR REPRESENTATIVE CERTAIN EDIBLES SUCH AS CHARLOTTE RUSSE SPANISH CREAM WINE JELLIES AND MOUSSES TO SAY NOTHING OF THE CAVIARS AND ANCHOVIES WERE WHOLLY UNKNOWN TO THEM
6818-68772-0015 MISTER FORBES ADMITTED THAT HE HAD UNDERTAKEN THIS CAMPAIGN BECAUSE HE WAS OPPOSED TO OFFENSIVE ADVERTISING SIGNS BUT NOW HE HAD BECOME INTERESTED IN OTHER ISSUES AND WAS ANXIOUS TO BE ELECTED SO THAT HE COULD CARRY ON THE WORK OF REFORM
6818-68772-0022 BUT PATSY'S WISE LITTLE HEAD COUNSELLED CAUTION IN HANDLING THE MATTER NOW THAT WE KNOW HER SECRET SHE SAID THE GIRL CANNOT CAUSE US MORE REAL HARM

6836-61803-0019 ON THE EDGE OF AN ETERNITY TOO TERRIBLE TO CONTEMPLATE TO A CONSCIENCE LIKE HIS IT CANNOT BE OTHERWISE THAN APPALLING ALL AT ONCE A LIGHT IS SEEN TO FLASK INTO HIS EYES
6836-61803-0026 ONCE MORE IN THEIR MIDST BEYOND THESE SOUNDS SOON CEASING THERE IS NOTHING TO HINDER THE CONFESSION FROM BEING CONTINUED I KNOW THAT I'VE GOT TO DIE PROCEEDS THE PRISONER WITH AN AIR OF SEEMING RECKLESSNESS

6836-61804-0003 NOR THAT HER HAPPINESS WAS HEIGHTENED ON LEARNING FROM THE ASTONISHED SPECTATORS HOW HER LOVER'S LIFE HAD BEEN PRESERVED AS IT MIGHT SEEM MIRACULOUSLY THE AIM OF THE ASSASSIN
6836-61804-0010 THE SPIRIT OF THE ARISTOCRATIC PLANTER STEEPED IN SORROW AND HUMILIATED BY MISFORTUNE HAD BECOME PURGED OF ITS FALSE PRIDE THOUGH IT NEEDED NOT THIS TO MAKE HIM WILLINGLY ACQUIESCE IN AN ALLIANCE
6836-61804-0017 TAKE POSSESSION OF HER SPIRIT AND THEN ONLY IN THE SHAPE OF A SHADOW SOON TO PASS AWAY IT WAS ONE DAY WHEN HER HUSBAND CAME HOME TO THE HACIENDA BEARING IN HIS ARMS THE BODY OF A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN

6848-252322-0021 IT WAS THIS FELLOW OR NOTHING AND BETTER A THOUSAND TIMES BETTER NOTHING SAID THE BOY THAN TRUST HIS LIFE TO THE COARSE IGNORANCE OF THIS WRETCHED QUACK AND IN HIS PASSION THE WORDS WERE UTTERED LOUD ENOUGH FOR BILLY TO OVERHEAR THEM
6848-252322-0028 SAID HE AS HE SEATED HIMSELF AND A FINE YOUNG CRAYTURE TOO PUER INGENUUS WITH A GRAND FRONTAL DEVELOPMENT AND WITH THIS REFLECTION HE ADDRESSED HIMSELF TO THE COARSE BUT ABUNDANT FARE WHICH CRAGGS PLACED BEFORE HIM

6880-216547-0002 YOU EXPRESSED THE FOLLOWING WISH THE ACADEMY REQUESTS THE TITULARY TO PRESENT IT ANNUALLY DURING THE FIRST FORTNIGHT IN JULY WITH A SUCCINCT AND LOGICAL STATEMENT OF THE VARIOUS STUDIES WHICH HE HAS PURSUED DURING THE YEAR
6880-216547-0016 THEREBY IT ASKED IN LESS GENERAL TERMS WHAT WAS THE CAUSE OF THE SOCIAL EVIL AND WHAT WAS ITS REMEDY YOU ADMITTED THAT YOURSELVES GENTLEMEN
6880-216547-0023 DARED TO MAINTAIN AND BELIEVED THAT HE HAD PROVED THAT THE INSTITUTION OF A DAY OF REST AT WEEKLY INTERVALS IS INSEPARABLY BOUND UP WITH A POLITICAL SYSTEM BASED ON THE EQUALITY OF CONDITIONS
6880-216547-0030 CAN IT NOT RENDER IT EQUAL FOR ALL HIS GRANDCHILDREN AND GREAT GRANDCHILDREN IF THE LAW NO LONGER HEEDS THE AGE OF ANY MEMBER OF THE FAMILY CAN IT NOT BY THE RIGHT OF HEREDITY
6880-216547-0044 I HAVE TOO MUCH NEGLECTED FORM AND STYLE IN VAIN SHOULD I HAVE TRIED TO DO BETTER LITERARY HOPE AND FAITH I HAVE NONE
6880-216547-0051 OF CONFOUNDING PERSONS AND THINGS AT PRESENT I CAN ONLY DESPISE AND COMPLAIN TO CEASE TO HATE I ONLY NEEDED TO KNOW
6880-216547-0058 MAY I BE THE LAST OF YOUR PENSIONERS OF ALL THE WISHES THAT I CAN FRAME THAT GENTLEMEN IS THE MOST WORTHY OF YOU AND THE MOST HONORABLE FOR ME
6880-216547-0072 I HASTEN TO THANK YOU FOR FORWARDING TO ME YOUR SECOND MEMOIR UPON PROPERTY I HAVE READ IT WITH ALL THE INTEREST THAT AN ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE FIRST WOULD NATURALLY INSPIRE I AM VERY GLAD THAT YOU HAVE MODIFIED SOMEWHAT
6880-216547-0079 THERE IS A REMEDY FOR THIS EVIL WITHOUT VIOLATING IT ALL THE MORE WITHOUT DESTROYING IT IF THE PRESENT LAWS ALLOW ABUSE WE CAN RECONSTRUCT THEM OUR CIVIL CODE IS NOT THE KORAN
6880-216547-0086 THAT IS WHAT I SAID TO THE INSTITUTE AT THE TIME WHEN I PRESENTED MY REPORT UPON YOUR BOOK I KNEW THAT THEY WISHED TO PROCEED AGAINST YOU IN THE COURTS YOU PERHAPS DO NOT KNOW BY HOW NARROW A CHANCE I SUCCEEDED IN PREVENTING THEM
6880-216547-0100 YOU HAVE NOT WRITTEN DIRECTLY FOR THEM YOU HAVE ISSUED TWO MAGNIFICENT MANIFESTOES THE SECOND MORE GUARDED THAN THE FIRST ISSUE A THIRD MORE GUARDED THAN THE SECOND
6880-216547-0107 FOR THE REST I ALLOW THAT IN THE PRESENT STATE OF THE QUESTION THE MIND MAY LEGITIMATELY HESITATE BEFORE DECIDING IN FAVOR OF THE ABOLITION OF PROPERTY
6880-216547-0114 A SYSTEM WHICH BETTER THAN PROPERTY GUARANTEES THE FORMATION OF CAPITAL AND KEEPS UP THE COURAGE OF ALL
6925-80680-0012 AND WHEN SHE HAD TOLD HER STORY THE FARMER CALLED HIS WIFE WHO LED HER TO THEIR HOUSE AND GAVE HER FOOD TO EAT AND A BED TO LIE ON AND IN THE FARM A FEW DAYS LATER A LITTLE PRINCE WAS BORN AND BY HIS MOTHER'S WISH NAMED AMEER ALI
6925-80680-0019 AND ON REACHING THE SPOT HE FOUND AN UGLY OLD WOMAN STREAMING WET AND CRYING LOUDLY AS SHE LIFTED FROM HER HEAD
6925-80680-0026 AND PROMISED THAT HE SHOULD ENTER HIS BODYGUARD ON THE CONDITION THAT HE WOULD UNDERTAKE ANY SERVICE WHICH WAS ESPECIALLY DIFFICULT OR DANGEROUS THIS WAS JUST WHAT AMEER ALI WANTED AND HE AGREED TO DO WHATEVER THE KING MIGHT WISH
6925-80680-0040 AND AS THE STORM HAD BY THIS TIME PASSED OVER HE MADE HIS WAY BACK TO THE PALACE WHEN HE HAD FINISHED HIS STORY HE TOOK THE ANKLET OUT OF HIS POCKET AND HANDED IT TO THE KING WHO LIKE EVERYONE ELSE WAS AMAZED AT THE GLORY OF THE JEWELS WHICH COMPOSED IT INDEED
6925-80680-0047 OR HE SHOULD BE HANGED FOR THE PRINCESS WOULD CERTAINLY DIE OF DISAPPOINTMENT POOR AMEER ALI WAS GREATLY TROUBLED AT THE KING'S COMMAND BUT HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF THAT HE HAD AT ANY RATE A MONTH IN WHICH TO LAY HIS PLANS HE LEFT THE PALACE AT ONCE
6925-80680-0054 AT LENGTH SHE PERSUADED HIM TO DO HER BIDDING HE NEARLY FAINTED HIMSELF WITH HORROR WHEN HE FOUND THAT AFTER THE CRUEL BLOW WHICH LOPPED HER FOOT OFF SHE LAY AS ONE LIFELESS BUT HE HELD THE SEVERED FOOT OVER THE CAULDRON AND AS DROPS OF BLOOD FELL FROM IT
6925-80680-0067 WHEN ON THE DAY APPOINTED AMEER ALI PRODUCED A NECKLACE AND BRACELETS EACH MORE BEAUTIFUL AND PRICELESS THAN THE LAST THE KING'S ASTONISHMENT KNEW NO BOUNDS AND AS FOR HIS DAUGHTER SHE WAS NEARLY MAD WITH JOY
6925-80680-0081 THEN THE FARMER TOLD THE KING AND HIS MINISTERS HOW HE HAD RESCUED THE QUEEN AND BROUGHT UP AMEER ALI AND HE FETCHED THE OLD QUEEN HERSELF WHOM HE HAD LEFT OUTSIDE AT THE SIGHT OF HER THE KING WAS FILLED WITH SHAME AND SELF REPROACH AND WISHED HE COULD HAVE LIVED HIS LIFE OVER AGAIN
696-92939-0009 BUT HER MOTHER WAS CLOSE TO HER HEART AND SHE SAW HER AS OFTEN AS SHE COULD I MAY BE LOOKED ON AS AN OLD MAID SHE IS REPORTED AS SAYING BUT WITH MY WORK AND MY MOTHER I AM A VERY HAPPY ONE AND DESIRE NOTHING MORE AS LONG AS I HAVE THESE TWO
696-92939-0016 ON THE NIGHT OF AUGUST FIFTH NINETEEN FIFTEEN WE ARE TOLD MISS CAVELL WAS TYING UP THE WOUNDS OF A WOUNDED GERMAN SOLDIER WHEN A GROUP OF ARMED MEN ENTERED THE ROOM AND THEIR LEADER TOLD HER ROUGHLY THAT SHE WAS UNDER ARREST
696-92939-0023 ANOTHER LAWYER WHO WAS A BELGIAN SUDDENLY APPEARED AND TOLD THE AMERICANS THAT THERE WAS NOT THE LEAST CAUSE FOR THEM TO WORRY AS MISS CAVELL WAS SURE TO RECEIVE ONLY JUST TREATMENT HE ALSO PROMISED TO LET THEM KNOW WHEN THE TRIAL WAS TO TAKE PLACE
696-92939-0037 IN BRIEF THE CASE AGAINST THE GERMAN AUTHORITIES IS AS FOLLOWS THEY HAD NOT PREVIOUSLY INFLICTED THE DEATH PENALTY FOR THE OFFENSE OF WHICH MISS CAVELL WAS ACCUSED THEY HAD KEPT HER IN SOLITARY CONFINEMENT AND PREVENTED HER FROM CONSULTING AN ADVOCATE UP TO THE TIME OF HER TRIAL
696-93314-0004 OH DON'T SHE CRIED I DON'T REALLY WANT THEM PLEASE NOT I WISH THEN SHE STOPPED BECAUSE HE WAS ALREADY SOME TWELVE FEET FROM THE GROUND AND SHE KNEW THAT ONE SHOULD NOT SPEAK TO A MAN WHO IS CLIMBING RUINED WALLS
696-93314-0011 NO HE WAS HANGING BY HIS HANDS ABOVE THE GREAT REFECTORY ARCH AND HIS BODY SWUNG HEAVILY WITH THE IMPETUS OF THE CHECKED FALL HE WAS MOVING ALONG NOW SLOWLY HANGING BY HIS HANDS NOW HE GRASPED AN IVY ROOT ANOTHER
696-93314-0025 FOR TO THE FATHER HE SEEMED JUST LIKE OTHER YOUNG MEN IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT THERE WERE SO MANY MORE OF THE SAME PATTERN FROM WHOM SHE MIGHT HAVE CHOSEN AND MANY OF THEM WELL OFF TOO HOWEVER THE LETTER LAY IN THE PROSPEROUS POCKET BOOK IN THE BREAST OF THE FATHER'S FROCK COAT
696-93314-0032 WHAT DID HE DIE OF FOR THE ANSWER WAS HEART AND IN IT THE DEVIL ROSE AND SHOWED THE ONLOOKER THE REALLY ONLY TRUE AND ARTISTIC WAY TO DEVELOP THE ACTION IN THIS SITUATION SO DRAMATIC IN ITS POSSIBILITIES
696-93314-0039 BUT YOU CAN'T GIVE ME UP IF I WON'T BE GIVEN UP CAN YOU HIS SMILE STRUCK HER DUMB IT WAS MORE CONVINCING THAN HIS WORDS
696-93314-0053 THE ONLOOKER REACHED OUT HIS HANDS AND CAUGHT AT PRAYER HE CAUGHT AT IT AS A DROWNING MAN CATCHES AT A WHITE GLEAM IN THE BLACK OF THE SURGING SEA ABOUT HIM IT MAY BE A PAINTED SPAR IT MAY BE EMPTY FOAM THE ONLOOKER PRAYED
696-93314-0060 AND HIMSELF ANSWERED HIM LIAR YOU HAVE NOT DONE YOUR BEST YOU WILL HAVE TO EAT YOUR LIE YES THOUGH IT WILL SMASH YOUR LIFE AND RUIN YOU SOCIALLY AND PROFESSIONALLY YOU WILL HAVE TO TELL HIM YOU LIED AND TELL HIM WHY
696-93314-0067 I'M CERTAIN HE WANTED YOU OUT OF THE WAY HE WANTED YOU TO GET KILLED OH HOW CAN PEOPLE BE SO CRUEL

7067-76048-0005 SHE LIKED HIS TURN OF THOUGHT SHE WATCHED HIM WITH A FAINT SMILE ON HER LIPS AS HE SPOKE AND SHE SPREAD HER OPINIONS BEFORE HIM CAREFULLY IN THAT SOFT VOICE OF HERS LIKE A SHY CHILD SHOWING ITS TREASURES TO SOME SUDDENLY TRUSTED AND FAVOURED VISITOR

7067-76048-0047 AFTER A SWIFT BUT COMPETENT TRAINING INTO A SHIRT WAIST AND AN OFFICE DOWN TOWN SHE HAD BEEN ENTRUSTED AT FIRST TO A HARVESTER CONCERN INDEPENDENT OF MISTER GRAMMONT BECAUSE HE FEARED HIS OWN PEOPLE WOULDN'T TRAIN HER HARD

7078-271888-0070 TEARS WELLED IN HER EYES SHE NODDED BUT DID NOT REPLY A DRY GREY DAY IN MARCH IT WAS SHOW SUNDAY THAT INSTITUTION IN THE ART WORLD WHEN THE PAINTER OPENS HIS STUDIO TO HIS FRIENDS AND THE PUBLIC
7078-271888-0077 WAS STANDING WITH A YOUNG GIRL IN THE CROWD AROUND THE EASEL WHY LOOK PAPA THAT FACE THE GIRL CRIED WHEN HER EYES FELL UPON THE CANVAS IT IS HER PORTRAIT SURELY THE SIGNORE CANNOT KNOW DIO
7078-271888-0084 WHILE HIS FACE ASSUMED A HARD DETERMINED EXPRESSION
7078-271888-0097 WAS PRONOUNCED ONE OF THE PICTURES OF THE YEAR THOUSANDS ADMIRED IT THE PAPERS WERE FULL OF LAUDATORY NOTICES BUT THE MAN WHO PAINTED IT UNAWARE OF THE FAME HE HAD SUDDENLY ACHIEVED WAS HIDING HIS SORROW SOMEWHERE IN THE VOSGES
7078-271888-0111 DEAD I CRIED IMPOSSIBLE YES SIR HER MAID DISCOVERED HER IN HER BOUDOIR LATE LAST NIGHT AND FOUND THAT SHE HAD TAKEN AN OVERDOSE OF MORPHIA WE SENT FOR THE DOCTOR
7113-86041-0010 AND WHERE AMONG THE HILLS TO LOOK FOR ANY WHO STRAYED AWAY THAT THEY TOO PROSPERED UNDER HIS CARE AND NOT ONE WAS LOST OR TORN BY WOLVES BUT THIS NEW MASTER WAS A HARD MAN AND BEGRUDGED HIM HIS WELL EARNED WAGES
7113-86041-0017 WHEN HE UNDERSTOOD THIS HE FLEW DOWN AGAIN IN A GREAT HURRY INTO THE THICKET AND TOOK THE FORM OF A HANDSOME YOUNG MAN THAT WAS THE BEST WAY AND HE FELL IN LOVE WITH THE GIRL THEN AND THERE
7113-86041-0024 WERE SPREAD OUT STRANGE FRUITS AND SWEETMEATS THE VERY SIGHT OF WHICH MADE THE PRINCESS LONG TO TASTE THEM SHE HESITATED A WHILE HOWEVER SCARCELY ABLE TO BELIEVE HER EYES
7113-86041-0038 ON THREE SIDES OF THE CASTLE LAY A LOVELY GARDEN WITH MASSES OF GAY SWEET FLOWERS AND VELVET LAWNS ALL COOL AND SHADY WHICH PLEASED THE EYE OF THE PRINCESS THE FRUIT TREES WERE HUNG WITH GOLDEN AND ROSY APPLES
7113-86041-0045 TAKE THIS LITTLE MANY COLOURED WAND AND WITH A TOUCH GIVE TO EACH ROOT THE FORM YOU DESIRE TO SEE WITH THIS HE LEFT HER AND THE PRINCESS WITHOUT AN INSTANT'S DELAY OPENED THE BASKET
7113-86041-0052 WHOSE NAME WAS BENI AND NOW ALL WENT CHEERFULLY IN THE CASTLE THE PRINCESS GAVE TO EACH OF THE MAIDENS HER TASK AND NEVER WAS MISTRESS BETTER SERVED FOR A WHOLE WEEK SHE ENJOYED THE DELIGHT OF HER PLEASANT COMPANY UNDISTURBED
7113-86041-0066 AND THE FIELDS ARE BARE AND DESOLATE FOR BELOW IN THE VALLEY WINTER REIGNS ONLY HERE IN YOUR PRESENCE SPRING IS HELD FAST AND WHEREVER YOUR FOOT IS SET THE GAY FLOWERS BLOOM HAVE PATIENCE FOR A LITTLE
7113-86041-0073 IN HER OWN MIND SHE WAS WONDERING IF BY ANY MEANS SHE MIGHT ESCAPE FROM HER CAPTIVITY AND AT LAST SHE HIT UPON A PLAN BY THIS TIME SPRING ONCE MORE REIGNED IN THE VALLEY AND THE GNOME SENT THE FIRES BACK TO THEIR PLACES IN THE DEEPS OF THE EARTH
7113-86041-0080 THIS TIME SHE CHANGED THE TURNIP INTO A MAGPIE FLUTTER FROM TREE TO TREE CHATTERING BIRD SAID SHE TILL YOU COME TO RATIBOR MY LOVE
7113-86041-0094 ASK SOME PROOF SWEETHEART SAID HE PUT MY OBEDIENCE AND MY PATIENCE TO SOME TEST BY WHICH YOU CAN JUDGE OF MY UNALTERABLE LOVE BE IT SO ANSWERED THE CRAFTY MAIDEN THEN GIVE ME
7113-86041-0101 BUT AS HE FELT TOLERABLY CERTAIN OF THE EXACT NUMBER OF TURNIPS IN THE FIELD BIG AND LITTLE TOGETHER HE HURRIED BACK EAGER TO PROVE TO HIS BELOVED ONE WHAT A DELIGHTFUL AND SUBMISSIVE HUSBAND HE WOULD BE HE FELT VERY WELL SATISFIED WITH HIMSELF
7113-86041-0108 HE PASSED THROUGH THE GARDENS WHICH FOR HIM HAD LOST THEIR CHARM AND THE SIGHT OF THE PRINCESS'S FOOTPRINTS ON THE GOLDEN SAND OF THE PATHWAY RENEWED HIS GRIEF ALL WAS LONELY EMPTY SORROWFUL
7148-59157-0011 TILL THE AGE OF SIXTEEN AND AFTERWARDS ENABLED HIM TO ATTEND GUY'S HOSPITAL AS A MEDICAL STUDENT IT IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO CREDIT THE ACCEPTED STORY THAT HE PASSED ALL HIS BOYHOOD WITHOUT MAKING ANY ATTEMPT
7148-59157-0018 IN JANUARY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN HE WROTE THE EVE OF SAINT AGNES DURING THE SPRING OF THAT YEAR HE WROTE THE ODE TO PSYCHE THE ODE ON A GRECIAN URN THE ODE TO A NIGHTINGALE
7148-59157-0025 WAS NOT TO BE A HAPPY LOVER BUT THE SLAVE OF A MINX IT WAS NOT A SLAVERY WITHOUT DIGNITY HOWEVER IT HAD THE DIGNITY OF TRAGEDY
7148-59157-0039 HAD HE LIVED LONGER HE MIGHT HAVE INVADED OTHER WORLDS HIS RECASTING OF HYPERION OPENS WITH A CRY OF DISTRUST IN THE ARTIST WHO IS CONTENT TO LIVE IN THE LITTLE WORLD OF HIS ART
7148-7763-0004 BUT AS A SERIOUS AND PERMANENT PERSONAL SATISFACTION TO REST UPON MY WHOLE RELIANCE WAS PLACED ON THIS AND I WAS ACCUSTOMED TO FELICITATE MYSELF ON THE CERTAINTY OF A HAPPY LIFE WHICH I ENJOYED
7148-7763-0011 IN VAIN I SOUGHT RELIEF FROM MY FAVOURITE BOOKS THOSE MEMORIALS OF PAST NOBLENESS AND GREATNESS FROM WHICH I HAD ALWAYS HITHERTO DRAWN STRENGTH AND ANIMATION I READ THEM NOW WITHOUT FEELING
7148-7763-0025 AND THE ANALYSING SPIRIT REMAINS WITHOUT ITS NATURAL COMPLEMENTS AND CORRECTIVES THE VERY EXCELLENCE OF ANALYSIS I ARGUED IS THAT IT TENDS TO WEAKEN AND UNDERMINE WHATEVER IS THE RESULT OF PREJUDICE
7148-7763-0032 HAD MADE PRECOCIOUS AND PREMATURE ANALYSIS THE INVETERATE HABIT OF MY MIND I WAS THUS AS I SAID TO MYSELF LEFT STRANDED AT THE COMMENCEMENT OF MY VOYAGE WITH A WELL EQUIPPED SHIP
7148-82991-0003 AND THERE'S NO HARM I TRUST IN CALLING HIM SO MARRY IS THERE NOT MINE HOST CRIED THE FOREMOST ATTENDANT I SPOKE OF HIM AS SUCH IN HIS OWN HEARING NOT LONG AGO AND HE LAUGHED AT ME
7148-82991-0016 GIVE THE KNAVE A CUP OF ALE AND LET HIM WASH DOWN HIS FOUL WORDS IN A HEALTH TO THE KING WISHING HIM A SPEEDY DIVORCE AND A NEW QUEEN
7148-82991-0023 FULL LENGTH UPON THE GROUND HIS COMPANIONS DREW THEIR SWORDS AND WOULD HAVE INSTANTLY FALLEN UPON THE STURDY OFFENDER IF MORGAN FENWOLF WHO WITH THE EARL OF SURREY WAS STANDING AMONG THE SPECTATORS HAD NOT RUSHED FORWARD AND CLOSING
7148-82991-0030 AT THE SUGGESTION OF THE DUKE OF SHOREDITCH TO TAKE THE OFFENDER TO THE CURFEW TOWER ACCORDINGLY THEY CROSSED THE LOWER WARD AND PASSING BENEATH AN ARCHWAY NEAR THE SEMICIRCULAR RANGE OF HABITATIONS ALLOTTED TO THE PETTY CANONS
7178-34644-0007 HAS BEEN WICKEDLY DESERTED ON THE DESERT COAST OF PORTLAND WITH THE INTENTION OF ALLOWING HIM TO PERISH OF HUNGER OF COLD AND OF SOLITUDE A CHILD TEN YEARS OLD
7178-34644-0014 WHICH STAMPS AN EVERLASTING LAUGH UPON THE FACE THE CHILD BY MEANS KNOWN ONLY TO HARDQUANONNE WAS PUT TO SLEEP AND MADE INSENSIBLE DURING ITS PERFORMANCE KNOWING NOTHING OF THE OPERATION WHICH HE UNDERWENT
7178-34644-0021 THE UNDERSIGNED BROUGHT UP AND KEPT FOR EIGHT YEARS FOR PROFESSIONAL PURPOSES THE LITTLE LORD BOUGHT BY US OF THE KING TO DAY FLYING FROM ENGLAND TO AVOID HARDQUANONNE'S ILL FORTUNE

7178-34644-0042 HARDQUANONNE THEN THE SHERIFF RESUMING THAT MONOTONOUS TONE OF VOICE WHICH RESEMBLES NOTHING ELSE AND WHICH MAY BE TERMED A JUDICIAL ACCENT TURNED TOWARDS THE SUFFERER
7178-34644-0049 AND LOOKING AT GWYNPLAINE NOW LAUGH FOR EVER AND HE HIMSELF BEGAN TO LAUGH THIS SECOND LAUGH WILDER YET THAN THE FIRST MIGHT HAVE BEEN TAKEN
7178-34644-0063 AND WITH AUTHORITY FROM THE LORD CHANCELLOR OF ENGLAND
7178-34644-0070 THE MAN WAS FAT AND PURSY AND WORE A COURT WIG AND A TRAVELLING CLOAK HE WAS RATHER OLD THAN YOUNG AND VERY PRECISE HE SALUTED GWYNPLAINE WITH EASE AND RESPECT
7178-34645-0001 AND THE COLONEL SENT IT TO THE HIGH ADMIRAL OF ENGLAND THE ADMIRAL MEANT THE ADMIRALTY WITH WAIFS THE ADMIRALTY MEANT BARKILPHEDRO BARKILPHEDRO HAVING UNCORKED AND EMPTIED THE BOTTLE
7178-34645-0015 LOOK AT MY ARM OBSERVE THE DESIGN I AM LACENAIRE SEE A TEMPLE OF LOVE AND A BURNING HEART PIERCED THROUGH WITH AN ARROW
7178-34645-0022 TO SET THE SIGN MANUAL TO CRIMES IS RIGHT ROYAL EVERY DEED DONE IS A DRAFT DRAWN ON THE GREAT INVISIBLE PAYMASTER A BILL HAD JUST COME DUE WITH THE OMINOUS ENDORSEMENT
7178-34645-0029 SECONDLY THERE IS A ROYAL RIGHT OF MUTILATION
7190-90542-0004 BUT THIS WAS ONLY BECAUSE PROFESSOR QUARLES PERSISTED IN REMAINING IN THE BACKGROUND IF I DID THE SPADE WORK THE DEDUCTIONS WERE HIS THEY WERE ALL CASES WITH PECULIAR FEATURES IN THEM
7190-90542-0011 SOON AFTER THE STORM BEGAN AND THAT SNOW HAD HIDDEN THE MURDERER'S TRACKS FROM THE WOOD THAT SNOW HAD DRIFTED ON TO THE DEAD BODY SEEMED TO ESTABLISH THIS THEORY
7190-90542-0018 THE FOREIGN CUT OF THE CLOTHES MAY BE OF IMPORTANCE HE SAID I AM NOT SURE IS THIS WOOD YOU MENTION OF ANY GREAT EXTENT NO IT RUNS BESIDE THE ROAD FOR TWO OR THREE HUNDRED YARDS TOWARD WITHAN NO IT WAS NEAR THE WITHAN END OF IT THAT THE DEAD MAN WAS FOUND
7190-90542-0032 WE TOOK ROOMS AT A HOTEL IN MEDWORTH QUARLES EXPLAINING THAT OUR INVESTIGATIONS MIGHT TAKE SOME DAYS NEXT MORNING INSTEAD OF GOING TO WITHAN AS I HAD EXPECTED HE TOOK ME TO THE POLICE COURT
7190-90542-0039 YOUR LIFE IS LIKELY TO DEPEND UPON IT AND KEEP YOUR EARS OPEN TO MAKE SURE NO ONE IS FOLLOWING US HE HAD BECOME KEEN LIKE A DOG ON THE TRAIL AND OLD AS HE WAS SEEMED INCAPABLE OF FATIGUE
7190-90542-0046 AH THIS LOOKS PROMISING QUARLES SAID SUDDENLY IN A CORNER OF THE WALL OR TO BE MORE PRECISE FILLING UP A RENT IN IT WAS A SHED ROUGHLY BUILT BUT WITH A DOOR SECURED BY A VERY BUSINESS LIKE LOCK I THINK THE SHED IS CLIMBABLE
7190-90542-0060 THEN THERE WAS A LIGHT AND SUDDEN TINY FLAMES IN THE DARK HE HAD EVIDENTLY GOT FUEL AND HAD STARTED A FIRE ON THE STONE SLAB AS THE FLAMES BRIGHTENED I WATCHED HIS RESTLESS FIGURE HE WAS NOT A YOUNG MAN
7190-90542-0067 FOR AN HOUR TWO THREE I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG THAT HORRIBLE BUNDLE SWUNG OVER THE FIRE AND THE MAN SAT ON HIS BLOCK OF WOOD STARING STRAIGHT BEFORE HIM
7190-90542-0074 HIS MOTHER WAS ECCENTRIC HER HUSBAND WAS RICH ENOUGH TO HAVE HER LOOKED AFTER AT HOME HAD SHE BEEN A POORER PERSON SHE WOULD HAVE DIED IN A MADHOUSE RELIGIOUS MANIA HERS WAS AND HER SON HAS INHERITED IT IN A CURIOUS FASHION
7190-90543-0003 AND SOON AFTER MIDNIGHT THE HOUSEHOLD HAD RETIRED NEITHER SIR JOSEPH NOR LADY MAYNARD NOR ANY OF THE SERVANTS WERE DISTURBED DURING THE NIGHT BUT NEXT MORNING IT WAS FOUND THAT BURGLARS HAD ENTERED THEY HAD GOT IN BY A PASSAGE WINDOW AT THE BACK
7190-90543-0017 IF MY IDEA WERE CORRECT IT WOULD MEAN THAT THEY HAD BEEN PUT THERE ON PURPOSE TO MISLEAD I EXAMINED THE THREE GLASSES ON THE DINING ROOM TABLE THERE WAS THE STAIN OF LIPS AT THE RIM OF ONE BUT NOT OF THE OTHER TWO ONLY ONE HAD BEEN DRUNK OUT OF
7190-90543-0031 WHEN A MYSTERY WAS CLEARED UP IT WAS EASY TO SAY THAT ZENA HAD PUT HIM ON THE RIGHT ROAD AND I CONSIDERED IT A WHIM OF HIS MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE
7190-90543-0038 HE HAD SEVERAL CABINETS IN HIS ROOM CONTAINING SPECIMENS AND EVERYTHING HAD BEEN TURNED ON TO THE FLOOR AND DAMAGED MORE OR LESS IN FACT ALTHOUGH NOTHING HAD BEEN TAKEN THE DAMAGE WAS CONSIDERABLE ON THE NIGHT OF THE BURGLARY DOCTOR WOOD WAS AWAY FROM HOME
7190-90543-0045 MUCH DEPENDED UPON THE ANSWER IF HE HAD
7226-86964-0012 WAS ONE OF THE MOST REMARKABLE ABORIGINES KNOWN TO ILLINOIS HISTORY IT WAS AT THE PROPHET'S TOWN AS WHITE CLOUD'S VILLAGE WAS KNOWN IN PIONEER DAYS THAT BLACK HAWK RESTED UPON HIS ILL FATED JOURNEY UP THE ROCK AND FROM HERE
7226-86964-0019 IT WAS A SCENE OF HOWLING DESOLATION RACK AND RUIN UPON EVERY HAND THE MUDDY TORRENT AT A VELOCITY OF FULLY EIGHT MILES AN HOUR WENT EDDYING AND WHIRLING AND DARTING AND ROARING AMONG THE GNARLED AND BLACKENED STUMPS THE PROSTRATE TREES
7226-86964-0026 WHILE THE STORM RAGED WITHOUT THE YOUNG MAN WHO WAS A SIMPLE HEARTED FELLOW CONFIDED TO US THE DETAILS OF HIS BRIEF CAREER HE HAD BEEN MARRIED BUT A YEAR HE SAID HIS LITTLE CABIN LAY A QUARTER OF A MILE BACK IN THE WOODS
7226-86964-0040 AND SET OUT ALONG A DEVIOUS WAY THROUGH A DRIVING MIST WHICH BLACKENED THE TWILIGHT INTO DUSK TO FIND THIS PLACE OF PUBLIC ENTERTAINMENT IT IS A LITTLE ONE STORY DILAPIDATED FARM HOUSE
7226-86964-0047 A YELLOW FIELD THICKLY PLANTED TO PURPLE PINEAPPLES A JAUNTY FORWARD CREATURE IN PIMPLES AND CURLS SHE RATTLED AWAY THROUGH A MOODY AND SANKEY HYMN BOOK THE WHEEZES AND GROANS OF THE ANTIQUE INSTRUMENT
7226-86964-0054 NECESSITATING THE USE OF THE BED AS A DRESSING PLACE AFTER THE FASHION OF A SLEEPING CAR BUNK THIS CUBBY HOLE OF A ROOM WAS ALSO THE WARDROBE FOR THE WOMEN OF THE HOUSEHOLD THE WALLS ABOVE THE BED BEING HUNG NEARLY TWO FEET DEEP
7226-86965-0007 JOE MY BOY YOU GO NOW AN DO SOME'N FER YER COUNTRY A CRACK SHOT LIKE YOU IS JOE SAYS I TO MYSELF AS KIN HIT A DUCK ON THE WING EVERY TIME AN NO MISTAKE
7226-86965-0014 THERE WAS HEAPS O BLOOD SPILT UNNECESSARY BY US BOYS A FIGHTIN TO SAVE THE OL FLAG
7226-86965-0021 WITH AN ABUNDANCE OF GOOD MATERIALS ALREADY ABOUT THEM AND RARE OPPORTUNITIES FOR READILY ACQUIRING MORE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF RURAL DAMES DO MANAGE TO PREPARE ASTONISHINGLY INEDIBLE MEALS
7226-86965-0035 THERE IS AN UNUSED MILL DAM GOING TO DECAY IN THE CENTRE THE MAIN CURRENT HAS WASHED OUT A BREADTH OF THREE OR FOUR RODS THROUGH WHICH THE PENT UP STREAM RUSHES WITH A ROAR AND A HUNDRED WHIRLPOOLS IT IS AN UGLY CREVASSE
7226-86965-0042 THEY STRONGLY ADVISED OUR GOING INTO ROCK ISLAND BY RAIL THE PRESENT LANDING WAS THE LAST CHANCE TO STRIKE A RAILWAY EXCEPT AT MILAN TWELVE MILES BELOW IT WAS NOW SO LATE THAT WE COULD NOT HOPE TO REACH MILAN BEFORE DARK
7226-86965-0049 ANKLE DEEP IN MUD FOR THE LATE RAINS HAD WELL MOISTENED THE BLACK PRAIRIE SOIL IT WAS A UNIQUE AND PICTURESQUE PROCESSION
7264-92310-0013 HE WAS MUDDLE HEADED ABOUT THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN A LARGE CIRCULATION AND A CIRCULATION SMALL BUT APPEALING TO THE RICH HE WOULD REFUSE ADVERTISEMENTS OF LUXURIES TO A PAPER READ BY HALF THE WEALTHIER CLASS IF HE HAD HEARD IN THE NATIONAL LIBERAL CLUB
7264-92310-0020 ALL OF WHICH NEED THE SUGGESTION OF ADVERTISEMENT THE NEWSPAPER OWNER AND THE ADVERTISER THEN WERE INTERMIXED BUT ON THE BALANCE THE ADVERTISING INTEREST BEING WIDER SPREAD WAS THE STRONGER AND WHAT YOU GOT WAS A SORT OF IMPOSITION
7264-92310-0027 THE DIFFERENCE BEING PAID BY THE ADVERTISEMENT SUBSIDY
7264-92314-0008 IF ANY ONE DOUBTS THAT THIS ADJECTIVE OFFICIAL CAN PROPERLY BE APPLIED TO OUR CAPITALIST PRESS TO DAY LET HIM ASK HIMSELF FIRST WHAT THE FORCES ARE WHICH GOVERN THE NATION AND NEXT WHETHER THOSE FORCES THAT GOVERNMENT OR REGIME
7264-92314-0015 I SAY THAT THE BIG DAILY PAPERS HAVE NOW NOT ONLY THOSE OTHER QUALITIES DANGEROUS TO THE STATE WHICH I HAVE DESCRIBED BUT THAT THEY HAVE BECOME ESSENTIALLY OFFICIAL THAT IS INSINCERE AND CORRUPT IN THEIR INTERESTED SUPPORT OF THAT PLUTOCRATIC COMPLEX WHICH IN THE DECAY OF ARISTOCRACY GOVERNS ENGLAND
7264-92314-0022 THERE ARE AMONG SUCH GUTTER SNIPES THOUSANDS WHOSE LUCK ENDS IN THE NATIVE GUTTER HALF A DOZEN WHOSE LUCK LANDS THEM INTO MILLIONS ONE OR TWO AT MOST WHO ON THE TOP OF SUCH A CAREER GO CRAZY WITH THE AMBITION OF THE PARVENU AND PROPOSE TO DIRECT THE STATE
7264-92316-0003 THE ORGANS OF OPINION PROFESSED A GENTEEL IGNORANCE OF THAT IDEA WHICH WAS MOST WIDESPREAD MOST INTENSE AND MOST FORMATIVE
7264-92316-0010 AGAIN OF A RELIGIOUS TEMPER IN THEIR SEGREGATION CONVICTION AND ENTHUSIASM THERE BEGAN TO APPEAR WHEN THE OPPRESSOR WAS MILD THE SMALL PAPERS DEFENDING THE RIGHTS OF OPPRESSED NATIONALITIES
7264-92316-0017 TO PAPERS LIKE THE DAILY TELEGRAPH OR THE TIMES WITH THE EPITHET CAPITALIST PUT AFTER THEM IN BRACKETS I THOUGHT THEN IT WAS THE GIVING OF AN ABNORMAL EPITHET TO A NORMAL THING
7264-92316-0031 THERE WAS MORE THAN THIS FOR LONG THE OWNER OF A NEWSPAPER HAD FOR THE MOST PART BEEN CONTENT TO REGARD IT AS A REVENUE PRODUCING THING THE EDITOR WAS SUPREME IN MATTERS OF CULTURE AND OPINION TRUE THE EDITOR BEING REVOCABLE AND POOR COULD NOT PRETEND TO FULL POLITICAL POWER
7264-92316-0038 THAT IS WHY YOU NEARLY ALWAYS FIND THE FREE PRESS DIRECTED BY MEN OF INTELLIGENCE AND CULTIVATION OF EXCEPTIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND CULTIVATION AND THAT IS WHERE IT CONTRASTS MOST WITH ITS OPPONENTS C
7264-92316-0045 BUT THAT SMALL NUMBER KNEW VERY WELL THAT WE WERE THUS IN REALITY GOVERNED BY MEN RESPONSIBLE TO NO ONE AND HIDDEN FROM PUBLIC BLAME
7278-104730-0013 MISTER ADAMS AGAIN PRESENTED TWO PETITIONS FOR THE ABOLITION OF SLAVERY IN THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA BUT WITHOUT GIVING RISE TO MUCH EXCITEMENT THE

730-358-0004 THIS WAS THE FOREST NEAR INGOLSTADT AND HERE I LAY BY THE SIDE OF A BROOK RESTING FROM MY FATIGUE UNTIL I FELT TORMENTED BY HUNGER AND THIRST THIS ROUSED ME FROM MY NEARLY DORMANT STATE
730-358-0011 THE ONLY OBJECT THAT I COULD DISTINGUISH WAS THE BRIGHT MOON AND I FIXED MY EYES ON THAT WITH PLEASURE SEVERAL CHANGES OF DAY AND NIGHT PASSED AND THE ORB OF NIGHT HAD GREATLY LESSENED WHEN I BEGAN TO DISTINGUISH MY SENSATIONS FROM EACH OTHER
730-358-0018 ONE DAY WHEN I WAS OPPRESSED BY COLD I FOUND A FIRE WHICH HAD BEEN LEFT BY SOME WANDERING BEGGARS AND WAS OVERCOME WITH DELIGHT AT THE WARMTH I EXPERIENCED FROM IT
730-358-0032 AFTER THEIR SUFFERINGS IN THE LAKE OF FIRE I GREEDILY DEVOURED THE REMNANTS OF THE SHEPHERD'S BREAKFAST WHICH CONSISTED OF BREAD CHEESE MILK AND WINE THE LATTER HOWEVER I DID NOT LIKE THEN OVERCOME
730-358-0039 HOWEVER MISERABLE FROM THE INCLEMENCY OF THE SEASON AND STILL MORE FROM THE BARBARITY OF MAN
730-358-0046 THE RAIN DROPPING BRANCHES AND DANK EARTH I ATE MY BREAKFAST WITH PLEASURE AND WAS ABOUT TO REMOVE A PLANK TO PROCURE MYSELF A LITTLE WATER WHEN I HEARD A STEP AND LOOKING THROUGH A SMALL CHINK I BEHELD A YOUNG CREATURE
730-358-0059 AND APPEARED BUSILY EMPLOYED IN DIGGING AND PULLING UP ROOTS
730-359-0008 A CONSIDERABLE PERIOD ELAPSED
730-359-0022 WHEN I LEARNED THE IDEAS APPROPRIATED TO EACH OF THESE SOUNDS AND WAS ABLE TO PRONOUNCE THEM
730-359-0029 ESPECIALLY WHEN HE ADDRESSED THE OLD MAN I COULD MENTION INNUMERABLE INSTANCES WHICH ALTHOUGH SLIGHT
730-359-0036 TO DISCOVER MYSELF TO THE COTTAGERS
730-359-0050 MY SPIRITS WERE ELEVATED BY THE ENCHANTING APPEARANCE OF NATURE
730-360-0006 ON HEARING THIS WORD FELIX CAME UP HASTILY TO THE LADY WHO WHEN SHE SAW HIM THREW UP HER VEIL
730-360-0013 AND POINTING TO HER BROTHER MADE SIGNS WHICH APPEARED TO ME TO MEAN THAT HE HAD BEEN SORROWFUL UNTIL SHE CAME SOME HOURS PASSED THUS WHILE THEY BY THEIR COUNTENANCES EXPRESSED JOY THE CAUSE OF WHICH I DID NOT COMPREHEND
730-360-0027 HE HAD CHOSEN THIS WORK HE SAID BECAUSE THE DECLAMATORY STYLE WAS FRAMED IN IMITATION OF THE EASTERN AUTHORS

7367-86737-0086 CARLINI RETURNED ANXIOUS TO SEE HIS MISTRESS AND ANNOUNCE THE JOYFUL INTELLIGENCE HE FOUND THE TROOP IN THE GLADE SUPPING OFF THE PROVISIONS EXACTED AS CONTRIBUTIONS FROM THE PEASANTS BUT HIS EYE VAINLY SOUGHT RITA AND CUCUMETTO AMONG THEM

7367-86737-0114 THEN EXTENDING HIS HAND THE OLD MAN SAID I THANK YOU MY SON AND NOW LEAVE ME ALONE
7402-59171-0009 IN SEARCH OF A GHOST WITH ITS BEARD ON FIRE HIS CRITICS OFTEN ACCUSE HIM IN REGARD TO THE INVENTION OF THE SHAW MYTH OF HAVING DESIGNED A POSTER RATHER THAN PAINTED A PORTRAIT
7402-59171-0016 ONE IS BOUND TO CONTRADICT HIM MISTER SHAW OFTEN THINKS HE IS PRESENTING TRUE HUMAN NATURE WHEN HE IS MERELY PRESENTING HIS OPINIONS ABOUT HUMAN NATURE THE HUMAN NATURE OF SOLDIERS OF ARTISTS OF WOMEN OR
7402-59171-0023 THE PROPORTION OF UNREALITY IS NOT OVERWHELMING IT HAS BEEN ENORMOUSLY EXAGGERATED AFTER ALL IF THE CHARACTER OF THE NEWSPAPER MAN IN THE DOCTOR'S DILEMMA IS MACHINE MADE
7402-59171-0037 THE DEFENCE OF MISTER SHAW HOWEVER DOES NOT DEPEND ON ANY REAL OR IMAGINARY RESEMBLANCE OF HIS PLAYS TO MOLIERE'S HIS JOY AND HIS MISERY BEFORE THE LUDICROUS SPECTACLE OF HUMAN LIFE ARE HIS OWN AND HIS EXPRESSION OF THEM

7402-90848-0050 AND KEEP HIS CAVERN TIDY HE WOULD BURN OUR FIELDS WITH HIS FIERY BREATH YET WHO I ASK YOU WOULD BE HOUSEKEEPER FOR A DRAGON
7402-90848-0057 THE DRAGON WAS ADVANCING TOWARD HER BOBO RAN DOWN INTO THE FIELD AND STOOD BESIDE TILDA READY TO DEFEND HER TO THE END THE DRAGON CAME NEARER AND NEARER SUDDENLY
7447-91186-0008 ALSO IT WOULD BRING YOU BUT LITTLE PLEASURE OR RENOWN IF YOU SHOULD PLAY BADLY

7447-91186-0043 DEVELOPING INTO EQUALLY CHARACTERISTIC PROGRESSIONS AND CADENCES IS A STRIKING FEATURE OF THE BACH FUGUE HIS SUITES EXALTED FOREVER THE FAMILIAR DANCE TUNES OF THE GERMAN PEOPLE HIS WONDERFUL CHROMATIC FANTASIA AND FUGUE
7447-91187-0006 HIS SENSITIVE NATURE LIKE THE MOST EXQUISITELY CONSTRUCTED SOUNDING BOARD VIBRATED WITH THE DESPAIRING SADNESS THE SUPPRESSED WRATH AND THE SUBLIME FORTITUDE OF THE BRAVE HAUGHTY
7447-91187-0020 TRUE ART SOFTENS THE HARSHEST ACCENTS OF SUFFERING BY PLACING SUPERIOR TO IT SOME ELEVATING IDEA SO IN THE MOST MELANCHOLY STRAINS OF HIS MUSIC ONE WHO HEEDS WELL MAY DETECT THE PRESENCE OF A LOFTY IDEAL
7447-91187-0027 AND RESOLVED TO SHOW THAT THE PIANO TOO COULD PRODUCE THRILLING EFFECTS IN THE SAME WAY HE HAD LISTENED TO THE HUMAN VOICE AND DETERMINED THAT THE SONG OF HIS OWN INSTRUMENT SHOULD BE HEARD
7447-91187-0034 HE MUST OFTEN HAVE ENDURED TORTURES FROM THE BEST OF HIS PUPILS BUT SO THOROUGHLY WAS HE CONSECRATED TO HIS ART THAT HE NEVER FALTERED IN HIS EFFORTS TO LIFT THOSE WHO CONFIDED IN HIM
7447-91187-0048 A MESSAGE DIRECTLY FROM HIM WOULD HAVE BEEN INVALUABLE TO STUDENTS AND MIGHT HAVE AVERTED MANY UNLUCKY MISAPPREHENSIONS OF HIMSELF AND HIS WORKS THOSE OF HIS CONTEMPORARIES WHO HAVE HARKENED WITH RAPTURE TO HIS PLAYING HAVE DECLARED THAT HE ALONE
7447-91187-0055 THE RUBATO FROM RUBARE TO ROB REPRESENTS A PLIABLE MOVEMENT THAT IS CERTAINLY AS OLD AS THE GREEK DRAMA IN DECLAMATION AND WAS EMPLOYED IN INTONING THE GREGORIAN CHANT
7447-91187-0062 AND HE SO SYSTEMATIZED THE USE OF THE PEDALS THAT THE MOST VARIED NUANCES COULD BE PRODUCED BY THEM IN MELODY AND GENERAL CONCEPTION HIS TONE POEMS SPRANG SPONTANEOUSLY FROM HIS GLOWING FANCY
7505-258958-0006 THE OBJECTIVE INCOME OF SOCIETY BEING THE ALGEBRAIC SUM OF THE GOODS ACQUIRED OR PARTED WITH BY ALL THE INDIVIDUALS WE SHOULD NOT UNDERSTAND THAT EITHER SOCIAL OR PRIVATE OBJECTIVE INCOMES INCLUDE ONLY MATERIAL GOODS
7505-258958-0013 WHILE TO GET OTHERS HE HAS NOT NEEDED TO USE UP THE ACCUMULATIONS OF THE PAST OR TO MORTGAGE THE FUTURE THE ONE KIND IS GROSS THE OTHER NET INCOME
7505-258958-0020 BECAUSE THERE IS NO PERMANENT FUND OF ACCUMULATED WEALTH CORRESPONDING TO IT THE IDEA OF REGULARITY CONNECTED WITH FUNDED INCOME IS NOT ESSENTIAL TO THE IDEA OF INCOME IN GENERAL
7505-258958-0034 TO BE USED BY A HUNGRY MAN FOR FOOD FOR A SHEEP TO BE KEPT FOR BREEDING OR FOR WOOL TO BE MADE INTO CLOTH NEXT YEAR HE MAY OVERLOOK THE DIFFERENCE IN THE GRADE OF WANTS COMPARED IN THIS CASE A GRATIFICATION
7505-258964-0005 OTHER TRACTS LESS FERTILE OR FOR SOME REASON LESS AVAILABLE ARE DITCHED TILED AND DIKED AND FERTILIZERS ARE CARRIED UP STEEP HILLSIDES TO MAKE A SOIL UPON THE VERY CRAGS
7505-258964-0012 SO AS TO MAKE A MORE EFFICIENT AGENT AND MACHINES IN TURN MAY BE ADJUSTED AS PARTS OF A LARGER SYSTEM OF PRODUCTION THE IDEAL OF THE MODERN FACTORY SYSTEM IS SO TO ARRANGE THE MACHINERY
7505-258964-0025 AGENTS OF THE SAME KIND MAY DIMINISH IN NUMBER EITHER ABSOLUTELY OR RELATIVELY
7505-258964-0032 AND IN TURN FOR BUSINESS PURPOSES RENTS THEREFORE RISE AND THIS RISE IS REFLECTED IN THE HIGHER SELLING VALUE OF THE LAND IF A NEW DEMAND ARISES FOR THE PRODUCT OF ANY MACHINE
7505-258964-0039 MORE ABNORMAL WILL BE THEIR TEMPORARY VALUE WHEN THEY ARE SUDDENLY NEEDED LAND NEAR THE SITE OF AN EXPOSITION TAKES ON A VERY

7505-83618-0008 LIGHT AND LIFE WERE TO HIM SYNONYMOUS THEREFORE ALL RELIGIONS PROMISE TO LEAD FROM NIGHT TO LIGHT FROM NIGHT TO HEAVENLY LIGHT THEREFORE HE WHO RESCUES IS EVER THE LIGHT OF THE WORLD
7505-83618-0015 THEY RECOGNIZED THEIR MAKER AND HUMBLED THEMSELVES BEFORE HIM HE WAS RECONCILED AND TAUGHT THEM ARTS AND AGRICULTURE INSTITUTIONS AND RELIGION MERITING THE TITLE THEY GAVE HIM OF PACHAYACHACHIC
7511-102419-0002 TO BEGIN WITH THE MORNING WE LEFT THE HOLTS ELIZABETH SUGGESTED THAT WE THREE WOMEN RIDE IN THE BUCKBOARD SO I SEATED MYSELF ON A ROLL OF BEDDING IN THE BACK PART
7511-102419-0009 AND I NEVER SAW SUCH PEOPLE YOU ARE JUST LIKE YOUR COUNTRY YOU HAVE FED ME CARED FOR ME AND BEFRIENDED ME A STRANGER

7511-102419-0037 BUT AS THE WHOLE WAY WAS CARPETED BY STRAWBERRY VINES AND THERE WERE LATE BERRIES TO TEMPT ME TO LOITER I HAD TO STAY ON THE WAGON I HAD NO IDEA A WAGON COULD BE GOT ACROSS SUCH PLACES MISTER STRUBLE DROVE FOR MISSUS O'SHAUGHNESSY
7511-102419-0044 THERE IS PLENTY OF WOOD WATER AND FEED AND LOOKING EASTWARD DOWN THE VALLEY SNOW COVERED CRAG TOPPED MOUNTAINS DELIGHT THE EYE THE AIR IS SO BRACING THAT WE ALL FEEL EQUAL TO ANYTHING
7511-102420-0001 I HAVEN'T ONE THING I TOLD HER I OWED YOU MORE LOVE THAN I COULD EVER PAY IN A LIFETIME AND SHE SAID WRITING SUCH LONG LETTERS IS A MIGHTY POOR WAY TO SHOW IT I HAVE BEEN NEGLECTING YOU SHAMEFULLY I THINK

7511-102420-0015 WE COULD HEAR THE ROAR OF THE GROS VENTRE AS IT TUMBLED GRUMBLINGLY OVER ITS ROCKY BED TO OUR RIGHT ROSE MILE AFTER MILE OF RED CLIFFS AS THE LAST OF THE QUAKING ASP LEAVES HAVE FALLEN THERE WERE NO GOLDEN GROVES
7511-102420-0029 FOR A WHILE WALKING WAS EASY AND WE MADE PRETTY GOOD TIME THEN WE HAD A ROCKY HILL TO GET OVER WE HAD TO USE CARE WHEN WE GOT INTO THE TIMBER THERE WERE MARSHY PLACES WHICH TRIED US SORELY
7511-102420-0036 AND THOSE BEHIND TURNED AND WENT BACK THE WAY THEY HAD COME MISTER HAYNES SHOUTED TO ME SHOOT SHOOT WHY DON'T YOU SHOOT SO I FIRED MY KRAG BUT NEXT I FOUND MYSELF PICKING MYSELF UP
7511-102420-0043 AND GO BACK EMPTY HANDED AND PARTLY TO GET A REST FROM MISTER MURRY'S EVERLASTING ACCORDION MISTER MURRY IS AN OLD TIME ACQUAINTANCE OF MISSUS O'SHAUGHNESSY'S HE HAS A RANCH DOWN ON THE RIVER SOMEWHERE MISSUS O'SHAUGHNESSY HAS NOT SEEN HIM FOR YEARS
7517-100429-0006 WHEN THE POND BEGAN TO FILL TO STRANGERS THIS MAY SEEM SURPRISING AND IT IS ONLY FAIR TO TELL THEM THE GREAT SECRET WHICH IS THAT MUCH OF THE SURROUNDING LAND
7517-100429-0013 I AM ONE OF THOSE WHO CANNOT WRITE LETTERS IN ANOTHER MAN'S HOUSE AND WHEN MY PIPE IS WELL ALIGHT I SAY TO MISS ROBINSON OR WHOEVER IT MAY BE LET'S GO AND LOOK AT THE POND
7517-100429-0020 FILLS YOU WITH THOUGHTS OF REVENGE FOR YOUR ACCIDENTAL DEFEAT THE EVENING BEFORE BUT INDOORS IT IS SO EASY TO DROP INTO A SOFA AFTER BREAKFAST AND ONCE THERE WITH ALL THE PAPERS

7517-100437-0028 AN EXPLANATION WHICH SUSPICIOUS STRANGERS REQUIRE FROM ME SOMETIMES I SHALL NOT DESCRIBE THE BOOK FOR NO DESCRIPTION WOULD HELP IT BUT I SHALL JUST SAY THIS
7517-100442-0007 IN AS FAR AS IT IS POSSIBLE TO A MAN WHO SELLS BOTH SCENTED SOAP AND PILCHARDS WOULD BECOME NARROW WE DO NOT COME INTO CONTACT WITH THE OUTSIDE WORLD MUCH SAVE THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF POTTED LOBSTER
7517-100442-0021 A RED LETTER DAY IN ALL THE GREAT STATIONS A GENTLEMAN IN A CHECK WAISTCOAT MAKES THE DOUBLE PURCHASE OF HOMER'S PENNY STORIES AND THE SPECTATOR ON THOSE OCCASIONS
7517-100442-0028 AND EVEN WHEN ONE OF THOSE SUBTLER CHARACTERS DRAWS NEAR ABOUT WHOM IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY IMMEDIATELY WHETHER THEY REQUIRE A FOUNTAIN PEN WITH CASE OR THE LIFE AND LETTERS
7635-105409-0000 MARGUERITE'S ACHING HEART STOOD STILL SHE FELT MORE THAN SHE HEARD THE MEN ON THE WATCH PREPARING FOR THE FIGHT HER SENSES TOLD HER THAT EACH WITH SWORD IN HAND WAS CROUCHING READY FOR THE SPRING
7635-105409-0014 BUT I ORDERED YOU JUST NOW WHEN THE WOMAN SCREAMED TO RUSH IN AND LET NO ONE ESCAPE BUT CITOYEN THE FOUR MEN WHO WERE THERE BEFORE HAD BEEN GONE SOME TIME I THINK YOU THINK YOU SAID CHAUVELIN ALMOST CHOKING WITH FURY AND YOU LET THEM GO
7635-105409-0021 HOW HE HAD CONTRIVED TO REACH THE HUT WITHOUT BEING SEEN BY ONE OF THE THIRTY SOLDIERS WHO GUARDED THE SPOT WAS MORE THAN CHAUVELIN COULD CONCEIVE THAT HE HAD DONE SO BEFORE THE THIRTY MEN HAD ARRIVED ON THE CLIFF WAS OF COURSE FAIRLY CLEAR
7635-105409-0028 THEN THE FISHERMAN'S TOOLS AND HIS NETS LYING IN ONE CORNER AND BESIDE THEM SOMETHING SMALL AND WHITE PICK THAT UP SAID CHAUVELIN TO THE SERGEANT POINTING TO THIS WHITE SCRAP AND BRING IT TO ME
7635-105409-0042 OBEDIENTLY THE SOLDIERS ROSE TO THEIR FEET YOU'D BETTER TRY AND FIND THAT FOOTPATH AGAIN FOR ME AND THAT BROKEN DOWN CART WE LEFT ON THE ROAD THEN SUDDENLY A BRIGHT IDEA SEEMED TO STRIKE HIM AH BY THE BYE WHERE IS THE JEW
7635-105409-0049 I SUPPOSE NOW THAT BEING A JEW YOU HAVE A GOOD MEMORY FOR BARGAINS ANSWER HE AGAIN COMMANDED AS THE JEW WITH TREMBLING LIPS SEEMED TOO FRIGHTENED TO SPEAK YES YOUR HONOUR STAMMERED THE POOR WRETCH
7635-105409-0056 HE DID NOT WAIT TO SEE HIS ORDERS CARRIED OUT HE KNEW THAT HE COULD TRUST THESE SOLDIERS WHO WERE STILL SMARTING UNDER HIS REBUKE NOT TO MINCE MATTERS WHEN GIVEN A FREE HAND TO BELABOUR A THIRD PARTY
7635-105409-0070 WHAT HAD BECOME OF PERCY WHAT OF ARMAND SHE KNEW NOTHING OF WHAT HAD HAPPENED AFTER SHE HEARD THE CHEERFUL SONG GOD SAVE THE KING WHICH SHE BELIEVED TO BE THE SIGNAL OF DEATH I MYSELF CONCLUDED CHAUVELIN MUST NOW VERY RELUCTANTLY LEAVE YOU
7635-105661-0005 EVERY TENET WILL BE ADOPTED THAT BEST SUITS THE DISORDERLY AFFECTIONS OF THE HUMAN FRAME CUSTOMERS WILL BE DRAWN TO EACH CONVENTICLE BY NEW INDUSTRY AND ADDRESS IN PRACTISING ON THE PASSIONS AND CREDULITY OF THE POPULACE
7635-105661-0012 THE SUPREME HEAD OF THE CHURCH WAS A FOREIGN POTENTATE GUIDED BY INTERESTS ALWAYS DIFFERENT FROM THOSE OF THE COMMUNITY SOMETIMES CONTRARY TO THEM AND AS THE HIERARCHY WAS NECESSARILY SOLICITOUS TO PRESERVE A UNITY OF FAITH RITES AND CEREMONIES
7635-105661-0026 AS YET AND TILL LONG AFTERWARDS MADE THE MOST INCONSIDERABLE PROGRESS NEITHER IS THERE ANY INSTANCE THAT ARGUMENT HAS EVER BEEN ABLE TO FREE THE PEOPLE FROM THAT ENORMOUS LOAD OF ABSURDITY
7635-105661-0033 CARRIED MATTERS MUCH FURTHER AND TREATED THE RELIGION OF THEIR ANCESTORS AS ABOMINABLE DETESTABLE DAMNABLE FORETOLD BY SACRED WRIT ITSELF AS THE SOURCE OF ALL WICKEDNESS AND POLLUTION THEY DENOMINATED THE POPE ANTICHRIST
7635-105661-0040 TO THOSE WHO WERE EITHER TIRED OF THE OBEDIENCE AND CHASTITY OR DISGUSTED WITH THE LICENSE IN WHICH THEY HAD HITHERTO LIVED THEY BLAMED THE EXCESSIVE RICHES THE IDLENESS
7780-274562-0004 WHAT HAS BEEN DEEMED THE MERE CHIMERA OF THE PERFECTIONISTS IN THE BRIEF EXISTENCE OF ELLISON I FANCY THAT I HAVE SEEN REFUTED THE DOGMA THAT IN MAN'S PHYSICAL AND SPIRITUAL NATURE LIES SOME HIDDEN PRINCIPLE
7780-274562-0011 OR RATHER ELEMENTARY PRINCIPLES OF BLISS THAT WHICH HE CONSIDERED CHIEF WAS STRANGE TO SAY THE SIMPLE AND PURELY PHYSICAL ONE OF FREE EXERCISE IN THE OPEN AIR THE HEALTH HE SAID
7780-274562-0018 AND SELDOM FAIL RADICALLY TO ALTER THE ENTIRE MORAL CONSTITUTION OF THOSE WHO ARE THEIR OBJECTS IT APPEARS THAT ABOUT ONE HUNDRED YEARS PRIOR TO MISTER ELLISON'S ATTAINMENT OF HIS MAJORITY THERE HAD DIED IN A REMOTE PROVINCE
7780-274562-0032 ENRICHING WHOLE TROOPS OF HIS RELATIVES BY DIVISION OF HIS SUPERABUNDANCE I WAS NOT SURPRISED HOWEVER
7780-274562-0039 IS IT NOT INDEED POSSIBLE THAT WHILE A HIGH ORDER OF GENIUS IS NECESSARILY AMBITIOUS THE HIGHEST IS INVARIABLY ABOVE THAT WHICH IS TERMED AMBITION
7780-274562-0046 NO DEFINITION HAD SPOKEN OF THE LANDSCAPE GARDENER AS OF THE POET YET MY FRIEND COULD NOT FAIL TO PERCEIVE THAT THE CREATION OF THE LANDSCAPE GARDEN OFFERED TO THE TRUE MUSE THE MOST MAGNIFICENT OF OPPORTUNITIES
7780-274562-0059 IT IS BUT THE HEADLONG SPIRIT OF GENERALIZATION WHICH HAS INDUCED HIM TO PRONOUNCE IT TRUE THROUGHOUT ALL THE DOMAINS OF ART HAVING I SAY FELT ITS TRUTH HERE
7780-274562-0066 THEREFORE HER SUSCEPTIBILITY OF IMPROVEMENT
7780-274562-0073 TO HAVE WELL TREATED THIS THEME THERE ARE PROPERLY HE WRITES BUT TWO STYLES OF LANDSCAPE GARDENING THE NATURAL AND THE ARTIFICIAL
7780-274562-0087 APPEALS DIRECTLY TO THE UNDERSTANDING AND CAN THUS BE FORESHADOWED IN RULE THE LOFTIER MERIT WHICH BREATHES AND FLAMES IN INVENTION OR CREATION CAN BE APPREHENDED SOLELY IN ITS RESULTS
7780-274562-0094 I REPEAT THAT THE PRINCIPLE HERE EXPRESSED IS INCONTROVERTIBLE BUT THERE MAY BE SOMETHING EVEN BEYOND IT THERE MAY BE AN OBJECT IN FULL KEEPING WITH THE PRINCIPLE SUGGESTED
7780-274562-0101 THEN THE SENTIMENT OF INTEREST IS PRESERVED WHILE THE ART IS MADE TO ASSUME THE AIR OF AN INTERMEDIATE OR SECONDARY NATURE A NATURE WHICH IS NOT GOD NOR AN EMANATION OF GOD
7794-295947-0009 SO THEY STROKED IT GENTLY ON THE BACK AND PETTED IT AND AS THE PAIN OF THE WOUND SEEMED TO HAVE SUBSIDED THEY WERE ADMIRING THE PROPERTIES OF THE HERB WHEN OPPOSITE TO THEM THEY SAW THE OLD FOXES SITTING WATCHING THEM BY THE SIDE OF SOME STACKS OF RICE STRAW
7794-295947-0016 LAST NIGHT THE FOX'S LIVER THAT YOU REQUIRED FELL INTO HIS HANDS SO HE SENT ME TO BRING IT TO YOU WITH THESE WORDS THE MESSENGER PRODUCED A SMALL JAR ADDING IN A FEW DAYS HE WILL LET YOU KNOW THE PRICE
7794-295947-0023 PRAY INQUIRE CAREFULLY INTO THE MATTER WELL THIS IS VERY STRANGE FOUR NIGHTS AGO A MAN OF SOME FIVE OR SIX AND THIRTY YEARS OF AGE CAME WITH A VERBAL MESSAGE FROM YOU TO THE EFFECT THAT YOU HAD SENT HIM WITH A FOX'S LIVER
7794-295947-0037 THE AFFAIRS OF THE BUDDHIST OR IMPORTED RELIGION ARE UNDER THE CARE OF THE FAMILY OF KANJUJI AS IT IS NECESSARY THAT THOSE WHO AS PRIESTS PERFORM THE HONOURABLE OFFICE OF SERVING THE GODS SHOULD BE PERSONS OF SOME STANDING
7794-295947-0044 FOR RETENTION CAUSED BY EITHER RENAL OR VESICAL CALCULI BUT I HAVE MYSELF THOROUGHLY EXPERIENCED THE UTILITY OF AN OIL I MAKE MYSELF WHEREOF SCORPIONS FORM A VERY LARGE PORTION OF THE INGREDIENTS
7794-295948-0004 BUT NOW I AM GROWING OLD AND THIS SEVERE COLD IS MORE THAN I CAN BEAR I PRAY YOU TO LET ME ENTER AND WARM MYSELF AT THE FIRE OF YOUR COTTAGE THAT I MAY LIVE THROUGH THIS BITTER NIGHT
7794-295948-0018 THE PRIEST THOUGHT THIS VERY STRANGE BUT IMAGINED EITHER THAT THE BADGER STAYED AWAY BECAUSE IT DID NOT LIKE TO COME WITHOUT THE MONEY OR THAT IT HAD BEEN KILLED IN AN ATTEMPT TO STEAL IT AND HE BLAMED HIMSELF FOR HAVING ADDED TO HIS SINS FOR NO PURPOSE
7794-295948-0025 IT CAME AND SPENT THE WINTER NIGHTS WITH HIM FROM THIS STORY IT IS PLAIN THAT EVEN BEASTS HAVE A SENSE OF GRATITUDE IN THIS QUALITY DOGS EXCEL ALL OTHER BEASTS
7794-295955-0005 THE OLD WOMAN ANSWERED THEY HAVE INDEED BUT THERE'S NO HELP FOR IT GO HOME MY SON LEST YOU FOLLOW THEM THEN HE SAID TO HER DEAR OLD WOMAN DO YOU KNOW WHAT I KNOW THAT YOU WILL BE GLAD TO LIBERATE YOURSELF FROM THAT PEST
7794-295955-0019 WHEN NIGHT APPROACHED THE PRINCE DROVE THE SHEEP AS BEFORE AND WENT HOME PLAYING THE BAGPIPES WHEN HE ARRIVED AT THE TOWN THE WHOLE TOWN WAS ASTIR AND BEGAN TO WONDER BECAUSE THE SHEPHERD CAME HOME EVERY EVENING WHICH NO ONE HAD BEEN ABLE TO DO BEFORE
7794-295955-0026 THEN HE SWUNG THE DRAGON AND TOSSED IT HIGH INTO THE AIR AND WHEN IT FELL TO THE GROUND IT BURST INTO PIECES BUT AS IT BURST INTO PIECES OUT OF IT SPRANG A WILD BOAR AND STARTED TO RUN AWAY BUT THE PRINCE SHOUTED TO HIS SHEPHERD DOGS
78-368-0001 THE WIND WHICH HAD FALLEN IN THE SOUTH NOW ROSE WITH GREAT VIOLENCE IN THE WEST THE MOON HAD REACHED HER SUMMIT IN THE HEAVENS AND WAS BEGINNING TO DESCEND
78-368-0015 BUT HE ELUDED ME LEAPED FROM HIS STATION AND RUNNING WITH THE SWIFTNESS OF LIGHTNING PLUNGED INTO THE LAKE THE REPORT OF THE PISTOL BROUGHT A CROWD INTO THE ROOM
78-368-0022 THE MURDER OF CLERVAL AND LASTLY OF MY WIFE EVEN AT THAT MOMENT I KNEW NOT THAT MY ONLY REMAINING FRIENDS WERE SAFE FROM THE MALIGNITY OF THE FIEND
78-368-0029 AND I MUST TELL IN A FEW WORDS WHAT REMAINS OF MY HIDEOUS NARRATION I ARRIVED AT GENEVA MY FATHER AND ERNEST YET LIVED BUT THE FORMER SUNK UNDER THE TIDINGS THAT I BORE
78-368-0043 I WOULD WILLINGLY AFFORD YOU EVERY AID IN YOUR PURSUIT BUT THE CREATURE OF WHOM YOU SPEAK APPEARS TO HAVE POWERS WHICH WOULD PUT ALL MY EXERTIONS TO DEFIANCE
78-368-0050 BUT ALL THAT I CAN SAY WILL BE OF LITTLE AVAIL MY REVENGE IS OF NO MOMENT TO YOU YET WHILE I ALLOW IT TO BE A VICE
78-369-0003 ALL THE HARDSHIPS WHICH TRAVELLERS IN DESERTS AND BARBAROUS COUNTRIES ARE WONT TO MEET HOW I HAVE LIVED I HARDLY KNOW
78-369-0016 SUDDENLY THE BROAD DISK OF THE MOON AROSE AND SHONE FULL UPON HIS GHASTLY AND DISTORTED SHAPE AS HE FLED WITH MORE THAN MORTAL SPEED I PURSUED HIM AND FOR MANY MONTHS THIS HAS BEEN MY TASK
78-369-0030 WHERE YOU WILL FEEL THE MISERY OF COLD AND FROST TO WHICH I AM IMPASSIVE YOU WILL FIND NEAR THIS PLACE IF YOU FOLLOW NOT TOO TARDILY A DEAD HARE
78-369-0044 HE HAD HARNESSED THEM AND THE SAME NIGHT TO THE JOY OF THE HORROR STRUCK VILLAGERS HAD PURSUED HIS JOURNEY ACROSS THE SEA IN A DIRECTION THAT LED TO NO LAND AND THEY CONJECTURED
78-369-0051 GAINED THE SUMMIT OF A SLOPING ICE MOUNTAIN AND ONE SINKING UNDER HIS FATIGUE DIED I VIEWED THE EXPANSE BEFORE ME WITH ANGUISH WHEN SUDDENLY MY EYE CAUGHT A DARK SPECK UPON THE DUSKY PLAIN
78-369-0058 SEVERAL OF MY DOGS DIED AND I MYSELF WAS ABOUT TO SINK UNDER THE ACCUMULATION OF DISTRESS WHEN I SAW YOUR VESSEL RIDING AT ANCHOR

8051-295385-0034 FOR IT CAME TO PASS THAT A GREAT CLOUD OF MOSQUITOS AROSE OUT OF THE MARSHY BORDERS OF THE RIVER AND SETTLED UPON THE FORTRESS OF HELSENBURG BEING DOUBTLESS ATTRACTED BY THE SCENT OF THE FRESH BLOOD OF THE SWEDISH GORMANDISERS
8063-274112-0009 AH IF I COULD ONLY HOLD THE BALANCING POLE WHILE YOU WERE DANCING IT WOULD BE A VERY DIFFERENT AFFAIR BUT MY DEAR MONSIEUR D'ARTAGNAN SAID THE KING GRAVELY PEOPLE DANCE WITHOUT BALANCING POLES

8063-274116-0015 AND HER EYES HALF CLOSED PURRING IN THAT SIGNIFICANT MANNER WHICH ACCORDING TO FELINE HABITS INDICATES PERFECT CONTENTMENT
8063-274116-0022 PLANCHET TURNED TO HIS HOUSEKEEPER YOU HAVE BEFORE YOU HE SAID TO HER

8063-274117-0016 MONSIEUR SAID PLANCHET I AM ONE OF THOSE GOOD HUMORED SORT OF MEN WHOM HEAVEN CREATED FOR THE PURPOSE OF LIVING A CERTAIN SPAN OF DAYS
8063-274117-0030 THE CAVALIER KNEELS AT THE BEGINNING THE YOUNG LADY BY AND BY GETS TAMED DOWN AND THEN IT IS SHE WHO HAS TO SUPPLICATE WHO IS THIS LADY I WOULD GIVE ANYTHING TO ASCERTAIN THIS SEEMED IMPOSSIBLE HOWEVER FOR ARAMIS WAS THE FIRST TO LEAVE
8088-284756-0001 THERE WAS REAL ROMANCE AND ADVENTURE RUM RUNNERS SEEKING OUT THEIR HIDDEN PORT WITH THEIR CARGO OF CONTRABAND FROM CUBA HEADING FEARLESSLY THROUGH THE DARKNESS FIGHTING THE HIGH SEAS STILL RUNNING AFTER THE STORM OF A DAY OR SO BEFORE
8088-284756-0008 USUALLY THE VERY SOUL OF COURTESY AND CONSIDERATION
8088-284756-0022 THE OTHER END OF THE ROOM WAS NEARLY ALL GLASS AND OPENED ONTO THE PATIO AND THE SWIMMING POOL MERCER PAUSED A MOMENT WITH HIS HAND ON THE KNOB OF THE DOOR A STRANGE LIGHT IN HIS DARK EYES NOW YOU'LL SEE WHY I CALLED YOU HERE HE SAID TENSELY
8088-284756-0029 THE GREAT CLOUD OF CORN COLORED HAIR FLOATED DOWN ABOUT IT FALLING BELOW THE KNEES SLOWLY WITH A GRACE OF MOVEMENT COMPARABLE ONLY WITH THE SLOW SOARING OF A GULL SHE CAME TOWARD ME WALKING ON THE BOTTOM OF THE POOL THROUGH THE CLEAR WATER AS THOUGH SHE FLOATED IN AIR
8088-284756-0036 LATE THIS AFTERNOON I DECIDED TO GO FOR A LITTLE WALK ALONG THE BEACH MERCER BEGAN I HAD BEEN WORKING LIKE THE DEVIL SINCE EARLY IN THE MORNING RUNNING SOME TESTS ON WHAT YOU CALL MY THOUGHT TELEGRAPH I FELT THE NEED OF SOME FRESH SEA AIR
8088-284756-0049 I THINK I HAVE WHAT YOU CALL MY THOUGHT TELEGRAPH PERFECTED EXPERIMENTALLY HE EXPLAINED RAPIDLY I FELL ASLEEP WORKING ON IT AT THREE O'CLOCK OR THEREABOUTS THIS MORNING AND SOME TESTS WITH CARSON SEEM TO INDICATE THAT IT IS A SUCCESS
8088-284756-0063 VERY NICE OLD CHAP CARSON IMPRESSIVE EVEN IN HIS BATHING SUIT MERCER WAS MIGHTY LUCKY TO HAVE A MAN LIKE CARSON SOMETHING SEEMED TO TICK SUDDENLY SOMEWHERE DEEP IN MY CONSCIOUSNESS YES THAT'S VERY TRUE
8088-284756-0077 PERHAPS I THOUGHT QUICKLY THIS WAS WITH HER A SIGN OF GREETING I LIFTED MY OWN ARM AND RETURNED THE SALUTATION IF SALUTATION IT WERE AWARE OF A STRANGE RISING AND FALLING SOUND AS OF A DISTANT HUMMING IN MY EARS
8088-284756-0084 BRING ONE OF YOUR GADGETS OVER HERE MERCER I CALLED ACROSS THE POOL I THINK I'M MAKING PROGRESS GOOD BOY HE CRIED AND CAME RUNNING WITH TWO OF THE ANTENNAE THE LONG INSULATED CORDS TRAILING BEHIND HIM THROUGH THE WATER THE GIRL WATCHED HIM EVIDENT DISLIKE IN HER EYES
8088-284756-0091 SO THAT MY HEAD REMAINED OUT OF WATER AND SMILED DOWN AT THE GIRL TOUCHING THE INSTRUMENT ON MY HEAD AND THEN POINTING TO HERS I COULD SENSE MERCER'S THOUGHTS NOW HE WAS PICTURING HIMSELF WALKING LONG THE SHORE WITH THE STORMY OCEAN IN THE BACKGROUND
8088-284756-0105 ITS NAKED RIBS PACKED WITH DRIFTED SAND SAUNTERING DREAMILY SHE MOVED AWAY FROM THE ANCIENT DERELICT SUDDENLY A DIM SHADOW SWEPT ACROSS THE SAND AT HER FEET AND SHE ARROWED FROM THE SPOT LIKE A WHITE SLIM METEOR
8088-284756-0112 THERE WAS A STRANGE FASCINATION ABOUT THIS GIRL FROM THE DEPTHS OF THE SEA A SUBTLE APPEAL THAT WAS ANSWERED FROM SOME DEEP SUBTERRANEAN CAVERN OF MY BEING I FORGOT FOR THE MOMENT WHO AND WHAT I WAS
8088-284756-0119 WE CAN TRY OLD TIMER I SAID A BIT SHAKENLY MERCER HURRIED BACK TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE POOL AND I ADJUSTED MY HEAD SET AGAIN SMILING DOWN AT THE GIRL
8095-274345-0013 COULD NOT FAIL TO EXCITE PUBLIC ENVY AND HOWEVER MEN'S HATRED MIGHT HAVE BEEN SUSPENDED FOR A MOMENT WHILE THE DUKE'S CONDUCT SEEMED TO GRATIFY THEIR PASSIONS AND THEIR PREJUDICES IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM LONG TO PRESERVE THE AFFECTIONS OF THE PEOPLE
8095-274345-0020 THE NATION WAS VERY LITTLE ACCUSTOMED AT THAT TIME TO THE BURDEN OF TAXES AND HAD NEVER OPENED THEIR PURSES IN ANY DEGREE FOR SUPPORTING THEIR SOVEREIGN EVEN ELIZABETH NOTWITHSTANDING HER VIGOR AND FRUGALITY
8095-274345-0027 THOUGH IT MUST BE REMARKED THAT THE CONNECTIONS WITH THAT CROWN WERE MUCH LESS OBNOXIOUS TO THE PROTESTANTS AND LESS AGREEABLE TO THE CATHOLICS THAN THE ALLIANCE FORMERLY PROJECTED WITH SPAIN AND WERE THEREFORE RECEIVED RATHER WITH PLEASURE THAN DISSATISFACTION
8095-274346-0005 THEY PETITIONED THE KING FOR REPLACING SUCH ABLE CLERGY AS HAD BEEN SILENCED FOR WANT OF CONFORMITY TO THE CEREMONIES THEY ALSO ENACTED LAWS FOR THE STRICT OBSERVANCE OF SUNDAY WHICH THE PURITANS AFFECTED TO CALL THE SABBATH
8095-274346-0012 RENDERED HIM MORE DEPENDENT AND MORE EXPOSED TO THE ENCROACHMENTS OF THE COMMONS HE WAS RESOLVED TO TRY ONCE MORE THAT REGULAR AND CONSTITUTIONAL EXPEDIENT FOR SUPPLY PERHAPS TOO A LITTLE POLITICAL ART WHICH AT THAT TIME HE PRACTISED
8095-274346-0019 AND IF THE KING EITHER CUT THEM SHORT IN THIS UNDERTAKING OR REFUSED COMPLIANCE WITH THEIR DEMANDS HE MUST NOT EXPECT ANY SUPPLY FROM THE COMMONS GREAT DISSATISFACTION WAS EXPRESSED BY CHARLES AT A TREATMENT WHICH HE DEEMED SO HARSH AND UNDUTIFUL
8095-274346-0033 BUT SO RIVETTED THROUGHOUT THE NATION WERE THE PREJUDICES WITH REGARD TO SPANISH DECEIT AND FALSEHOOD THAT VERY FEW OF THE COMMONS SEEM AS YET TO HAVE BEEN CONVINCED THAT THEY HAD BEEN SEDUCED BY BUCKINGHAM'S NARRATIVE
8095-274346-0040 IN ALL CHRISTIAN KINGDOMS YOU KNOW THAT PARLIAMENTS WERE IN USE ANCIENTLY BY WHICH THOSE KINGDOMS WERE GOVERNED IN A MOST FLOURISHING MANNER UNTIL THE MONARCHS BEGAN TO KNOW THEIR OWN STRENGTH AND SEEING THE TURBULENT SPIRIT OF THEIR PARLIAMENTS AT LENGTH
8095-274346-0047 AND TO SHOW SOME DEGREE OF PRECIPITANCY AND INDISCRETION MOVED BY THIS EXAMPLE THE HOUSE OF PEERS WERE ROUSED FROM THEIR INACTIVITY AND CLAIMED LIBERTY FOR THE EARL OF ARUNDEL WHO HAD BEEN LATELY CONFINED IN THE TOWER
8095-274348-0003 WAS DISMISSED WITH A REPROOF WHICH SAVORED MORE OF KINDNESS THAN OF ANGER INFORMATION OF THIS CORRESPONDENCE WAS SOON CARRIED TO RICHELIEU THE VIGILANCE OF THAT MINISTER WAS HERE FURTHER ROUSED BY JEALOUSY
8095-274348-0010 AFTER PEACE WAS CONCLUDED WITH THE FRENCH KING UNDER CHARLES'S MEDIATION THE AMBITIOUS CARDINAL WAS STILL MEDITATING THE DESTRUCTION OF THE HUGONOTS THAT PREPARATIONS WERE SILENTLY MAKING IN EVERY PROVINCE OF FRANCE FOR THE SUPPRESSION OF THEIR RELIGION
8095-274348-0017 HASTENED THE VENGEANCE OF THEIR MASTER EXHAUSTED THEIR PROVISIONS IN SUPPLYING THEIR ALLIES AND WERE THREATENED WITH AN IMMEDIATE SIEGE
8098-275181-0013 EACH A WAD OF FINE DRY GRASS AS LARGE AS A QUART BOX THESE WERE GATHERED UP AND FILLED THE GREAT BASKET THERE SAID HE TRIUMPHANTLY DON'T THEM SMELL MOUSEY THEY DID CERTAINLY
8098-275181-0020 THEN IN DUMB SHOW KNOCKED MY HEAD WITH A STONE D'YE SEE NOW HE DEMANDED I SAW BUT A FOX WOULD BITE YOU I OBJECTED LET HIM BITE SAID TOM
8098-275181-0027 HE SAID NOT A WORD AND LEFT ME TO POKE ABOUT AND STUMBLE ON THE LIMP WARM CARCASS OF A LARGE FOX THAT LAY NEAR BITE YE I EXCLAIMED AFTER SATISFYING MYSELF THAT THE FOX WAS DEAD SOME SAID TOM
8098-278252-0006 ONLY MAKING THIRTEEN MILES
8098-278252-0020 CANTON DID HIM HONOR I WITNESSED THE LEAVE TAKING AT HIS HOUSE HIS RIDE TO THE TRAIN IN THE COACH DRAWN BY FOUR GREYS UNDER ESCORT OF A BAND
8098-278252-0034 A PINT OF CORNED OYSTERS LIGHT WEIGHT SOME CRACKERS AND LEAF LARD TO TAKE THE PLACE OF BUTTER AND A CAKE OF BITTER CHOCOLATE I LEFT A FEW THINGS UNMOLESTED SUCH AS SOAP
8098-278278-0000 BY MAC A'RONY YOU DO ILL TO TEACH THE CHILD SUCH WORDS HE TEACHES HIM TO KICK AND TO HACK WHICH THEY'LL DO FAST ENOUGH OF THEMSELVES AND TO CALL HORUM FYE UPON YOU
8098-278278-0007 AND KICKED SO FRANTICALLY WHEN THE PRIEST TOOK HER IN HIS ARMS THAT TWO FLATIRONS WERE TIED TO ITS FEET TO KEEP THEM DOWN IT WAS SIMPLY NERVOUSNESS BECAUSE THE HIGH ALTITUDE AFFECTED THE CHILD'S NERVES
8098-278278-0021 IT HAS BEEN ESTIMATED BY VARIOUS ORNITHOLOGISTS BOTANISTS AND ENTOMOLOGISTS THAT THE STUMP IS MILLIONS OF YEARS OLD I THINK THEY WERE GUESSING AT IT FOR I COULDN'T SEE THE RINGS
8098-278278-0028 A BOARD SIGN INFORMED US IT WAS SIMPLY TURKEY CREEK I COULDN'T SEE ANY TURKEYS BUT THERE WAS GOOD PASTURAGE AROUND THE HOT TRIP THROUGH THE TIMBER MADE US ALL HUNGRY
8098-278278-0035 IN THE FIRST PLACE IT WOULD BE WORTH A HAIRBREADTH ESCAPE TO SEE ONE WILD I'VE ONLY SEEN BEARS IN CIRCUSES OR TRAVELING CHAINED TO ITALIANS IN THE SECOND PLACE I CAN RUN I'VE PLENTY OF MEDALS FOR SPRINTING
8108-274318-0008 WERE THE POOREST POSSIBLE ALLIES TO CAREFUL OBSERVATION AT FIRST HE WAS ONLY AWARE THAT THE DOG WAS REPEATING HIS SHORT DANGEROUS BARK FROM TIME TO TIME SNAPPING VICIOUSLY AT THE EMPTY AIR A FOOT OR SO FROM THE GROUND ONCE INDEED
8108-274318-0015 MEMORY OF HIS IDENTITY OF WHERE HE WAS OF WHAT HE OUGHT TO DO THE VERY FOUNDATIONS OF HIS STRENGTH WERE SHAKEN
8108-274318-0022 SOMETHING FROM THE REGION OF UTTER COLD WAS UPON HIM AND THEN QUITE SUDDENLY THROUGH THE CONFUSED MISTS ABOUT HIM THERE SLOWLY ROSE UP THE PERSONALITY THAT HAD BEEN ALL THE TIME DIRECTING THE BATTLE SOME FORCE ENTERED HIS BEING
8108-274318-0036 AND THE WHIRL OF RUSHING SHADOW CATS DISAPPEARED WHENCE THEY CAME AND WITH THE RETURN OF THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF HIS OWN IDENTITY JOHN SILENCE WAS RESTORED TO THE FULL CONTROL OF HIS OWN WILL POWER IN A DEEP MODULATED VOICE
8108-274318-0043 CLEARLY HE WAS ANXIOUS TO MAKE AMENDS FOR THE MISCHIEF TO WHICH HE HAD UNWITTINGLY LENT HIMSELF OWING TO HIS SUBTLE AND ELECTRIC CONSTITUTION STILL UTTERING HIS SHARP HIGH PURRINGS HE MARCHED UP TO HIS MASTER AND RUBBED VIGOROUSLY AGAINST HIS LEGS
8108-280354-0001 AND HE PLAYED SO SWEETLY WHEN THEY PASSED THE ROCKS OF THE SIRENS THAT THE DREADFUL MONSTERS SANG THEIR MOST ALLURING STRAINS IN VAIN
8108-280354-0015 ELSE THE BOON WE GRANT YOU WILL BE BUT VAIN A STEEP PATH LED UPWARD FROM THE REALM OF DARKNESS AND THE WAY WAS HARD TO FIND THROUGH THE GLOOM IN SILENCE ORPHEUS LED ON TILL THE GOAL WAS CLOSE AT HAND
8108-280354-0022 OAK POPLAR LIME BEECH LAUREL ASH PINE PLANE AND MAPLE AND MANY ANOTHER TREE HAD GATHERED TOGETHER HERE DRAWN FROM THEIR DISTANT FOREST HOMES BY THE SOUNDS OF ORPHEUS'S LYRE
8108-280354-0029 AND THREW IT WITH HIS LYRE INTO THE RIVER HEBRUS THERE IT FLOATED DOWN STREAM AND STRANGE TO TELL THE CHORDS GAVE FORTH A LAMENT AND THE LIFELESS TONGUE UTTERED WORDS
8108-280359-0011 AND SHE WOULD HAVE HIDDEN HIM FROM THE JUST ANGER OF THE GODS IF SHE COULD BUT THE TWO SONS CARED LITTLE ABOUT THEIR FATHER'S DREAD AND DANGER THEY SPENT ALL THEIR TIME IN QUARRELING WITH EACH OTHER AND THEIR LOUD ANGRY VOICES SOUNDING ABOVE THE WATERFALL
8108-280359-0018 SAW THAT SOMETHING LIVING HAD CERTAINLY TOUCHED THEM THEY THEN ADDED A WEIGHT TO THE NET AND THREW IT WITH SUCH FORCE THAT IT REACHED THE BOTTOM OF THE RIVER AND DRAGGED UP THE STONES IN THE POOL LOKI NOW SAW THE DANGER HE WAS IN OF BEING CAUGHT IN THE NET AND
8108-280359-0025 BE ABLE TO TORMENT THE INHABITANTS OF MANHEIM OR ASGARD BY HIS EVIL DOINGS THOR PROPOSED TO RETURN TO ASGARD TO BRING A CHAIN WITH WHICH TO BIND THE PRISONER BUT ODIN ASSURED HIM THAT HE HAD NO NEED TO TAKE SUCH A JOURNEY
8123-275193-0010 IN THIS ACT OF COURTESY HE IS ALWAYS ACCOMPANIED BY THE OFFICER OF THE DECK AND OFTEN BY OTHERS THAT MAY HAPPEN TO BE AT HAND AFTER THE ADVENT OF JEFF WHENEVER I WENT ON BOARD THE LOUISIANA HE WAS ALWAYS AT THE GANGWAY
8123-275193-0017 WAS MADE MORE GLORIOUS BY THE EXCHANGE OF CAMP HOSPITALITIES AND AN INDULGENCE IN SUCH SIMPLE HILARITY AS THE OCCASION SEEMED TO REQUIRE BUT JEFF WAS NOT FORGOTTEN EARLY IN THE MORNING HE WAS BATHED AND SCRUBBED
8123-275193-0024 IT WAS HIS HABIT TO GO FROM ONE FORE CASTLE MESS TO ANOTHER AND TO INSIST UPON HAVING RATHER MORE THAN HIS SHARE OF THE CHOICE MORSELS FROM EACH IN A SHORT TIME HE CAME TO THE REPAIR SHOP VERY MUCH THE WORSE FOR WEAR WITH AN IMPAIRED DIGESTION
8123-275209-0009 WHOM SHOULD THE CATERPILLAR CONSULT THERE WAS THE SHAGGY DOG WHO SOMETIMES CAME INTO THE GARDEN BUT HE WAS SO ROUGH HE WOULD MOST LIKELY WHISK ALL THE EGGS OFF THE CABBAGE LEAF WITH ONE BRUSH OF HIS TAIL
8123-275209-0016 I BELIEVE EVERYTHING I AM TOLD OBSERVED THE CATERPILLAR HASTILY WELL THEN FIRST OF ALL I WILL TELL YOU WHAT THESE LITTLE CREATURES ARE TO EAT WHAT DO YOU THINK IT IS TO BE GUESS
8123-275209-0023 THEN I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING ELSE CRIED THE LARK FOR THE BEST OF MY NEWS REMAINS BEHIND YOU WILL ONE DAY BE A BUTTERFLY YOURSELF WRETCHED BIRD EXCLAIMED THE CATERPILLAR
8123-275216-0002 THE BEAR THE WOLF AND THE FOX WENT OUT HUNTING WHILE THE STAG GRAZED BY THE EDGE OF THE FEN THE FIELD MOUSE SAT OUTSIDE HIS HOLE AND ATE ACORNS AND THE BEAVER BUILT HIS ARTISTIC HOUSES BY THE RIVER BANKS
8123-275216-0009 WHAT KIND OF TREES CAN THEY BE WHOSE LEAVES SIT SO CLOSE TOGETHER THAT THE SUNBEAMS CANNOT CREEP BETWEEN THEM ASKED A LITTLE OAK WHO WAS LISTENING TO WHAT THE BIG ONES WERE TALKING ABOUT BUT BY HIS SIDE STOOD AN OLD GNARLED TREE
8123-275216-0016 THE SNOW LAY HIGH OVER THE WHOLE LAND AND EVERY TREE STOOD DEEP IN HIS OWN THOUGHTS AND DREAMT OF THE SPRING AND WHEN THE SPRING CAME THE GRASS STOOD GREEN AND THE BIRDS BEGAN SINGING WHERE THEY LEFT OFF LAST
8123-275216-0030 THAT IS NOT A POLITE WAY OF SPEAKING TO AN OLD TREE WITH MOSS ON HIS BOUGHS SAID THE OAK I BEGIN TO REPENT THAT I WAS SO KIND TO YOU IF YOU HAVE A SPARK OF HONOURABLE FEELING ALIVE IN YOU
8123-275216-0037 AND GRINNED INTO THE BARGAIN AT THE OLD OAK WHILE HE LAY AND RESTED IN THE SHADOW OF THE BEECHES THE FIELD MOUSE WAS BESIDE HIMSELF WITH JOY OVER HIS NEW FOOD AND THOUGHT THAT BEECH NUTS TASTED MUCH NICER THAN ACORNS
8123-275216-0044 WHAT AN OLD STUPID I WAS BEFORE THAT WE OAK TREES WERE LORDS IN THE LAND AND NOW EVERY YEAR I SEE MY BROTHERS AROUND ME PERISHING IN THE FIGHT AGAINST YOU IT WILL SOON BE ALL OVER WITH ME
8226-274369-0012 BUT THE TIDE OF POPULARITY SEIZED MANY AND CARRIED THEM WIDE OF THE MOST ESTABLISHED MAXIMS OF CIVIL POLICY AMONG THE OPPONENTS OF THE KING ARE RANKED THE EARL OF NORTHUMBERLAND LORD ADMIRAL A MAN OF THE FIRST FAMILY AND FORTUNE
8226-274369-0019 HE HAD HEARKENED TO THE DISCOURSE OF CERTAIN PERSONS UNKNOWN TO HIM AND HAD HEARD THEM TALK OF A MOST DANGEROUS CONSPIRACY A HUNDRED AND EIGHT RUFFIANS AS HE LEARNED HAD BEEN APPOINTED TO MURDER A HUNDRED AND EIGHT LORDS AND COMMONERS
8226-274369-0026 THESE GENTLEMEN GAVE THE RABBLE THE APPELLATION OF ROUNDHEADS ON ACCOUNT OF THE SHORT CROPPED HAIR WHICH THEY WORE THESE CALLED THE OTHERS CAVALIERS AND THUS THE NATION
8226-274369-0040 HE WAS APT TO ASCRIBE THEM IN A GREAT MEASURE TO HIS OWN INDOLENCE AND FACILITY THE QUEEN AND THE LADIES OF THE COURT FURTHER STIMULATED HIS PASSION AND REPRESENTED THAT
8226-274369-0047 HOW COULD SUCH AN ATTEMPT BE CONSIDERED AS TREASON AFTER THE ACT OF OBLIVION WHICH HAD PASSED AND AFTER THAT BOTH HOUSES WITH THE KING'S CONCURRENCE HAD VOTED THAT NATION THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND POUNDS FOR THEIR BROTHERLY ASSISTANCE
8226-274369-0054 YESTERDAY I SENT A SERJEANT AT ARMS TO DEMAND SOME WHO BY MY ORDER WERE ACCUSED OF HIGH TREASON INSTEAD OF OBEDIENCE I RECEIVED A MESSAGE I MUST HERE DECLARE TO YOU
8226-274371-0004 THAT THOSE WHO ADVISED HIS MAJESTY'S ANSWER WERE ENEMIES TO THE STATE AND MISCHIEVOUS PROJECTORS AGAINST THE SAFETY OF THE NATION THAT THIS DENIAL IS OF SUCH DANGEROUS CONSEQUENCE THAT IF HIS MAJESTY PERSIST IN IT
8226-274371-0011 AS HE PROFESSED A RESOLUTION STRICTLY TO OBSERVE THE LAW HIMSELF SO WAS HE DETERMINED HE SAID TO OBLIGE EVERY OTHER PERSON TO PAY IT A LIKE OBEDIENCE THE NAME OF THE KING WAS SO ESSENTIAL TO ALL LAWS
8226-274371-0018 MIGHT BE MAINTAINED UPON VERY PLAUSIBLE TOPICS BUT THAT THE DANGER ALLOWING IT TO HAVE ANY EXISTENCE WAS NOT OF THAT KIND GREAT URGENT INEVITABLE WHICH DISSOLVES ALL LAW AND LEVELS ALL LIMITATIONS
8226-274371-0032 THAT THE KING SEDUCED BY WICKED COUNSEL INTENDED TO MAKE WAR AGAINST HIS PARLIAMENT WHO IN ALL THEIR CONSULTATIONS AND ACTIONS HAD PROPOSED NO OTHER END BUT THE CARE OF HIS KINGDOMS
8226-274371-0039 THAT HE EXPECTED FROM THEM NO OBEDIENCE TO ANY COMMANDS WHICH WERE NOT WARRANTED BY THE LAWS OF THE LAND THE PEERS ANSWERED THIS DECLARATION BY A PROTEST
8226-274371-0046 THEIR DEMANDS CONTAINED IN NINETEEN PROPOSITIONS AMOUNTED TO A TOTAL ABOLITION OF MONARCHICAL AUTHORITY THEY REQUIRED THAT NO MAN SHOULD REMAIN IN THE COUNCIL WHO WAS NOT AGREEABLE TO PARLIAMENT
8238-274553-0006 MANNERS PERSONS PURSES AND PROPENSITIES OF THE WHOLE COMMUNITY WHICH SURROUNDED HIM AN INFLUENCE THE MOST EXTENSIVE AND DESPOTIC YET AT THE SAME TIME THE MOST INDEFINITE AND ALTOGETHER UNACCOUNTABLE
8238-274553-0013 I QUAINTLY TERMED THE DOMINATION OF THE BARON RITZNER VON JUNG EVER RIGHTLY ENTERED INTO THE MYSTERY WHICH OVERSHADOWED HIS CHARACTER I TRULY THINK THAT NO PERSON AT THE UNIVERSITY WITH THE EXCEPTION OF MYSELF
8238-274553-0020 FROM HIS OWN PERSON TO THE ABSURDITIES TO WHICH HE HAD GIVEN RISE IN NO INSTANCE BEFORE THAT OF WHICH I SPEAK HAVE I KNOWN THE HABITUAL MYSTIFIC ESCAPE
8238-274553-0033 I PERCEIVED THE EXCITEMENT OF THE LATTER MOMENTLY INCREASING AT LENGTH HE SPOKE OFFERING SOME OBJECTION TO A POINT INSISTED UPON BY R AND GIVING HIS REASONS IN DETAIL
8238-274553-0047 STRIKING THE REFLECTION OF HIS PERSON WITH GREAT PRECISION AND OF COURSE SHATTERING THE GLASS INTO FRAGMENTS THE WHOLE COMPANY AT ONCE STARTED TO THEIR FEET AND WITH THE EXCEPTION OF MYSELF AND RITZNER TOOK THEIR DEPARTURE
8238-274553-0061 I HAVE GREAT RELIANCE HOWEVER ON THAT EXTREME DELICACY OF DISCRIMINATION IN MATTERS APPERTAINING TO THE RULES OF ETIQUETTE
8238-274553-0068 HE HANDED ME THE VOLUME AND ASKED ME TO LOOK OVER SOME PORTION OF IT I DID SO BUT TO LITTLE PURPOSE NOT BEING ABLE TO GATHER THE LEAST PARTICLE OF MEANING HE THEN TOOK THE BOOK HIMSELF AND READ ME A CHAPTER ALOUD TO MY SURPRISE
8238-283452-0000 INTRODUCTION THE HUMOROUS GHOST IS DISTINCTLY A MODERN CHARACTER IN EARLY LITERATURE WRAITHS TOOK THEMSELVES VERY SERIOUSLY
8238-283452-0014 THE UP TO DATE GHOST KEEPS HIS SKELETON IN A GARAGE OR SOME PLACE WHERE IT IS CLEANED AND OILED AND KEPT IN GOOD WORKING ORDER THE MODERN WRAITH HAS SOLD HIS SHEET TO THE OLD CLO'ES MAN AND DRESSES AS IN LIFE
8238-283452-0021 GHOSTS NOT ONLY HAVE APPALLINGLY LONG MEMORIES BUT THEY POSSESS A MEAN ADVANTAGE OVER THE LIVING IN THAT THEY HAVE ONCE BEEN MORTAL
8238-283452-0028 KICKING HIS HEELS AGAINST THE RAILING AND HEARS HIS ADMONITION THAT HE'D BETTER HURRY UP AS THE LIVE UNCLE IS COMING IN SIGHT
8238-283452-0042 SHOW THE DIVERSITY OF THE ENGLISH HUMOR AS ASSOCIATED WITH APPARITIONS AND ARE ENTERTAINING IN THEMSELVES THE CANTERVILLE GHOST BY OSCAR WILDE IS ONE OF HIS BEST SHORT STORIES
83-11691-0001 BUT FOR THE MOMENT I CANNOT SEE BEYOND THE SADNESS OF IT THAT TO A PRINCE OF THE ROYAL HOUSE OF ARABY
83-11691-0008 I THINK I'M COMING OUT WONDERING WHAT IT ALL MEANT CORONEL WAITED IN SILENCE YES I AM COMING OUT CORONEL SAID THE VOICE BUT YOU MUSTN'T BE SURPRISED IF I DON'T LOOK VERY WELL
83-11691-0022 HE SAT UP SUDDENLY AND STARED AT CORONEL IT WAS THAT OLD WOMAN DID IT YOU MARK MY WORDS CORONEL SHE DID IT WHY SHOULD SHE
83-11691-0029 THEY WERE AFRAID OF ME HE BEGAN TO LOOK SO MUCH HAPPIER THAT CORONEL THOUGHT IT WAS A FAVOURABLE MOMENT IN WHICH TO WITHDRAW SHALL I GO NOW YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS
83-11691-0036 THIS HE REJECTED AT ONCE WHEN YOU HAVE THE HEAD OF A RABBIT THE TAIL OF A LION AND THE MIDDLE OF A WOOLLY LAMB THE NEED FOR ACTION OF SOME KIND IS IMPERATIVE
83-3054-0004 ARE SAID TO BE UPWARDS OF ONE HUNDRED FATHOMS BELOW THE SURFACE OF THE SEA ON THE SIDES OF WHICH THERE WAS A GREAT VARIETY OF TALL NOBLE TREES LOADED WITH MARINE FRUIT SUCH AS LOBSTERS CRABS OYSTERS SCOLLOPS
83-3054-0011 THEREFORE I HAD NO INCLINATION TO PROLONG THE TIME ADD TO THIS MY SITUATION WAS IN OTHER RESPECTS VERY UNPLEASANT I MET MANY LARGE FISH WHO WERE IF I COULD JUDGE BY THEIR OPEN MOUTHS
83-3054-0018 AND IT WAS MY UNFORTUNATE LOT TO LAY THE FOUNDATION FOR BRINGING THIS HAPPY PAIR TOGETHER AGAIN I CAN EASILY CONCEIVE WHAT EXECRATIONS THE HUSBAND LOADED ME WITH WHEN ON HIS RETURN
83-9960-0012 WHAT THAT YOUNG GIRL WHOM THEY WERE ABDUCTING WAS NOT TO BE BROUGHT BACK ONE OF THOSE MONSTERS WAS TO BEAR HER OFF INTO THE DARKNESS WHITHER AND WHAT IF IT WERE SHE IT WAS CLEAR THAT IT WAS SHE
83-9960-0019 SHE PAUSED CHOKING THEN WENT ON
83-9960-0026 FINALLY HE SAID TO THE PRISONER WITH A SLOW AND SINGULARLY FEROCIOUS TONE
83-9960-0040 AT THE SAME MOMENT HE EXTENDED HIS ARM AND LAID THE GLOWING CHISEL WHICH HE HELD IN HIS LEFT HAND BY ITS WOODEN HANDLE
83-9960-0047 THE ONE ENJOINING HIM TO RESPECT HIS FATHER'S TESTAMENT THE OTHER CRYING TO HIM TO RESCUE THE PRISONER THESE TWO VOICES CONTINUED UNINTERRUPTEDLY THAT STRUGGLE WHICH TORMENTED HIM TO AGONY UP TO THAT MOMENT
83-9960-0054 REPLIED THENARDIER SINCE PONINE HAS THROWN THE STONE THROUGH THE WINDOW IT INDICATES THAT THE HOUSE IS NOT WATCHED ON THAT SIDE THE MASK WITH THE VENTRILOQUIST'S VOICE DEPOSITED HIS HUGE KEY ON THE FLOOR
831-130739-0010 HE WOULD HAVE DANCED ABOUT BEHIND THE COUNTER HAVE NEATLY REFOLDED THE GOODS HE HAD SHOWN YOU HAVE PUT ON ONE SIDE THOSE YOU SELECTED EXTRACTED A LITTLE BOOK WITH A CARBON LEAF AND A TINFOIL SHEET FROM A FIXTURE
831-130739-0017 THE THING THAT MUST BE TOLD IF THE BOOK IS TO BE WRITTEN WAS LET US FACE IT BRAVELY THE REMARKABLE CONDITION OF THIS YOUNG MAN'S LEGS LET US APPROACH THE BUSINESS WITH DISPASSIONATE EXPLICITNESS
831-130739-0024 FIRED BY THESE DISCOVERIES AN INVESTIGATOR MIGHT PERHAPS HAVE PURSUED HIS INQUIRIES FURTHER TO BRUISES ON THE SHOULDERS ELBOWS AND EVEN THE FINGER JOINTS OF THE CENTRAL FIGURE OF OUR STORY
831-130739-0038 BUT ENOUGH OF THESE REVELATIONS THE CENTRAL FIGURE OF OUR STORY IS NOW GOING ALONG BEHIND THE COUNTER A DRAPER INDEED WITH YOUR PURCHASES IN HIS ARMS TO THE WAREHOUSE WHERE THE VARIOUS ARTICLES YOU HAVE SELECTED WILL PRESENTLY BE PACKED BY THE SENIOR PORTER AND SENT TO YOU
831-130739-0045 THE SHOP WALKER BRINGS UP PARALLEL TO THE COUNTER ANY PARTICULAR TIME WHEN YOU WANT YOUR HOLIDAYS HE ASKS HOOPDRIVER PULLS AT HIS SKIMPY MOUSTACHE NO DON'T WANT THEM TOO LATE SIR OF COURSE
831-130739-0052 SAID HOOPDRIVER AS CALMLY AS POSSIBLE PULLING AT THE INSUFFICIENT MOUSTACHE
831-130746-0003 THEN STEPHEN THE WAITER WHO HAD SHOWN HOOPDRIVER UP CAME DOWN AND LIT WONDERFUL LIGHTS AND STARTED QUITE A FRESH DISCUSSION BY THE SIMPLE QUESTION WHICH THAT TURNED TEN MINUTES INTO A QUARTER OF AN HOUR AND IN THE MIDST OF THIS DISCUSSION
831-130746-0010 IF SO HE WAS IN FOR AN EXPLANATION BUT HE HAD IT READY SHE WAS A MONOMANIAC LEAVE ME ALONE WITH HER HE WOULD SAY I KNOW HOW TO CALM HER MISSUS BEAUMONT SAID STEPHEN WELL HAS GONE
831-130746-0017 STEPHEN WAS TOO SURPRISED TO SAY ANYTHING BUT BOURBON SIR GO ON SAID BECHAMEL DAMN YOU STEPHEN'S SYMPATHIES CHANGED AT ONCE YESSIR HE MURMURED FUMBLING FOR THE DOOR HANDLE AND LEFT THE ROOM MARVELLING
831-130746-0031 THEY SCARCELY HEEDED WHITHER THEY RODE AT FIRST BEING ONLY ANXIOUS TO GET AWAY TURNING ONCE WESTWARD WHEN THE SPIRE OF CHICHESTER CATHEDRAL ROSE SUDDENLY NEAR THEM OUT OF THE DEWY NIGHT PALE AND INTRICATE AND HIGH
831-130746-0038 SHE WHO HAS SPIRITUALISED THE WORLD ALONE SAVE FOR TWO ATTENDANT STEADY SHINING STARS AND IN SILENCE UNDER HER BENIGN INFLUENCE UNDER THE BENEDICTION OF HER LIGHT RODE OUR TWO WANDERERS SIDE BY SIDE THROUGH THE TRANSFIGURED AND TRANSFIGURING NIGHT
831-130746-0045 HE WAS TAKEN WITH A SUDDEN SHAME OF HIS HOMELY PATRONYMIC IT'S AN UGLY NAME HE SAID BUT YOU ARE RIGHT IN TRUSTING ME I WOULD I WOULD DO ANYTHING FOR YOU THIS
831-130746-0059 I SUPPOSE YOU WON'T TAKE ANYTHING JESSIE THE GLORY OF HAVING HER EVEN AS A SISTER AND TO CALL HER JESSIE LIKE THAT BUT HE CARRIED IT OFF SPLENDIDLY AS HE FELT HIMSELF BOUND TO ADMIT GOOD NIGHT SIS HE SAID AND PLEASANT DREAMS
8312-279790-0005 BY HIS FIRST MARRIAGE HE HAD ONE DAUGHTER CALLED FLORINA OR THE LITTLE FLORA BECAUSE SHE WAS SO FRESH AND LOVELY AT THE TIME OF HIS SECOND MARRIAGE SHE WAS QUITE FIFTEEN YEARS OLD THE NEW QUEEN ALSO HAD A DAUGHTER
8312-279790-0012 FOUR MEN IN MASKS ENTERED AND CARRIED HER OFF LEAVING HER IN A DARK CELL AND IN THE UTMOST DESOLATION MEANTIME KING CHARMING EAGERLY AWAITED HER RE APPEARANCE BUT HE SAW HER NO MORE
8312-279790-0026 HOW GREAT WAS HIS DESPAIR WHEN SOUSSIO SAID TO HIM IN A COMMANDING VOICE KING CHARMING BEHOLD THE PRINCESS TROUTINA TO WHOM YOU HAVE PROMISED YOUR FAITH MARRY HER IMMEDIATELY
8312-279790-0033 HIS BODY WASTED INTO THE SLENDER SHAPE OF A BIRD AND WAS COVERED WITH BRIGHT BLUE FEATHERS HIS EYES BECAME ROUND AND BEADY HIS NOSE AN IVORY BEAK AND HIS CROWN WAS A WHITE PLUME ON THE TOP OF HIS HEAD
8312-279790-0040 BUT IT WAS TOO DARK TO SEE WHO SHE WAS AND AT DAYLIGHT SHE SHUT THE WINDOW NEXT NIGHT IT WAS BROAD MOONLIGHT AND THEN HE SAW CLEARLY THE FIGURE OF A YOUNG GIRL WEEPING SORE AND KNEW THAT IT WAS HIS BELOVED FLORINA
8312-279791-0002 AND ADORN YOUR CHAMBER WITH FLOWERS I HAVE LEISURE ENOUGH I MAY JUST AS WELL SPEND SOME OF IT IN ADORNING MYSELF INSTEAD OF BEMOANING MY MISFORTUNE INNOCENT AS I AM INNOCENT INDEED CRIED THE QUEEN
8312-279791-0009 WHO WARBLED IN HER EAR AND TOUCHED HER GENTLY WITH HIS BEAK THE SPY LISTENED AND HEARD ALL THEIR CONVERSATION VERY MUCH ASTONISHED THAT A PRINCESS COULD BE SO FOND OF A MERE BIRD WHEN DAY CAME
8312-279791-0016 PEOPLE ONLY JUDGE BY THE OUTSIDE MEANTIME FLORINA OVERCOME WITH GRIEF FELL DANGEROUSLY SICK AND IN HER SICKNESS SHE KEPT SINGING DAY AND NIGHT HER LITTLE SONG BLUE BIRD BLUE BIRD
8312-279791-0030 SHE SANK DOWN AT THE FOOT PREPARED TO DIE THERE WHEN SHE BETHOUGHT HERSELF OF THE EGGS LET ME SEE SAID SHE IF THE FAIRY HAS DECEIVED ME OR NOT SO SHE BROKE ONE AND INSIDE IT WERE LITTLE HOOKS OF GOLD
8312-279791-0037 AND THE OTHER FOR TROUTINA THEY ARRIVED SHORTLY HE MORE CHARMING AND SHE MORE REPULSIVE THAN EVER KNITTING HER BROWS TROUTINA EXCLAIMED WHAT CREATURE IS THAT WHO DARES APPROACH SO NEAR MY GOLDEN THRONE
8312-279791-0044 AND MADE THE MICE GALLOP AND THE LADIES AND GENTLEMEN BOW TILL THE PRINCESS WAS DELIGHTED AND READY TO BUY THE CURIOSITY AT ANY PRICE AGAIN FLORINA EXACTED PERMISSION TO PASS THE NIGHT IN THE CHAMBER OF ECHOES AND AGAIN THE KING
8324-286681-0003 I HAVE HEARD SOME QUEER THINGS ABOUT THE EELS MYSELF SAID THE STICKLEBACK BUT I HAVE NEVER FELT MUCH AFRAID OF THEM I SUPPOSE I AM BRAVER BECAUSE I WEAR SO MANY OF MY BONES ON THE OUTSIDE JUST THEN
8324-286681-0017 THEY HAVE LARGE MOUTHS AND TEETH IN THEIR MOUTHS AND THEY ARE ALWAYS STICKING OUT THEIR LOWER JAWS AND HOW DO BEGAN THE BIGGEST LITTLE CRAYFISH ASK ME THAT TO MORROW SAID THEIR TEACHER
8324-286682-0006 AND THEIR TAPERING BUSHY TAILS WERE ALMOST BLACK THEIR UNDER JAWS WERE WHITE AND THEY WERE VERY PROUD OF THEM PERHAPS IT WAS BECAUSE THEY HAD SO LITTLE WHITE FUR THAT THEY THOUGHT SO MUCH OF IT YOU KNOW THAT IS OFTEN THE WAY
8324-286682-0013 AND TOLD THEM THAT IT WAS NOT THE TIP OF HIS TAIL
8324-286682-0020 IT WAS NOT NEAR THE RIVER AND NONE OF HIS FRIENDS WOULD HAVE FOUND HIM IF BIG BROTHER HAD NOT HAPPENED ALONG HE COULD HARDLY BELIEVE WHAT HE SAW WAS IT POSSIBLE THAT A TRAP HAD DARED TO CATCH A MINK WITH A WHITE TIPPED TAIL
8324-286682-0034 HAS THE BUSHIEST TAIL OR THE LONGEST FUR OR THE THICKEST PADS ON HIS FEET NOW SAID THE BACHELOR WE WILL TALK ABOUT LUCK WE WILL GO TO A PLACE WHERE NOBODY CAN HEAR WHAT WE SAY
8324-286682-0041 THE BACHELOR SMILED AGAIN I ALWAYS TELL PEOPLE SAID HE THAT MY LUCK IS NOT IN MY TAIL AND THEY NEVER BELIEVE IT I WILL TELL YOU THE SECRET OF MY LUCK
8324-286682-0048 AND WORKED UNTIL HE HAD LEARNED TO BE AS LUCKY AS THE BACHELOR THEN HE MARRIED THE PERSON HE WANTED AND SHE WAS VERY VERY HANDSOME IT IS SAID THAT ONE OF THEIR SONS HAS A WHITE TIPPED TAIL
8324-286683-0013 AND WHEN THEY WERE OLD ENOUGH TO LOOK OUT FOR THEMSELVES FIVE MORE CAME TO LIVE IN THE OLD NEST AND WHEN THESE WERE OLD ENOUGH TO LEAVE THE NEST ANOTHER FIVE WERE BORN IT DOESN'T MEAN SO MUCH TO MUSKRATS TO BE BROTHERS AND SISTERS AS IT DOES TO SOME PEOPLE
8324-286683-0020 WHEN THEY WERE COLD AND HUNGRY THEY SLAPPED THEIR TAILS ON THE GROUND OR ON THE WATER AND SAID DON'T YOU THINK YOU'RE SMART
8324-286683-0027 WHICH WAS SO AND THE OLDER ONE ANSWERED BACK WELL YOU'RE NOT SO GOOD LOOKING WHICH WAS ALSO TRUE THEN PART OF THE BROTHERS AND SISTERS
839-130898-0002 IN THE AFTERMATH OF THIS STORM WE WERE THROWN BACK TO THE EAST AWAY WENT ANY HOPE OF ESCAPING TO THE LANDING PLACES OF NEW YORK OR THE SAINT LAWRENCE IN DESPAIR
839-130898-0009 AT THESE TROUBLE SPOTS SO PROMINENT IN THE STATISTICS CAPE RACE SAINT PAUL ISLAND THE STRAIT OF BELLE ISLE THE SAINT LAWRENCE ESTUARY
839-130898-0016 HERE A HUGE BONEYARD FORMS FROM FISH MOLLUSKS
839-130898-0030 MERCY LOOK AT THESE COD HE SAID WHY I THOUGHT COD WERE FLAT LIKE DAB OR SOLE
839-130898-0037 THE TOTAL IS THE SAME FINE CONSEIL REPLIED I'LL TAKE MASTER'S WORD FOR IT I WON'T COUNT THEM COUNT WHAT THOSE ELEVEN MILLION EGGS BUT I'LL MAKE ONE COMMENT
839-130898-0044 THAT I SPOTTED THIS CABLE LYING ON THE SEAFLOOR CONSEIL WHOM I HADN'T ALERTED MISTOOK IT AT FIRST FOR A GIGANTIC SEA SNAKE AND WAS GEARING UP TO CLASSIFY IT IN HIS BEST MANNER
839-130898-0058 HAD ENDED HAPPILY AND IN ITS FIRST DISPATCH YOUNG AMERICA ADDRESSED OLD EUROPE WITH THESE WISE WORDS SO RARELY UNDERSTOOD GLORY TO GOD IN THE HIGHEST AND PEACE ON EARTH TO MEN OF GOOD WILL
839-130898-0065 THEN WE RETURNED TO THE LOCALITY WHERE THE EIGHTEEN SIXTY THREE ACCIDENT HAD TAKEN PLACE THERE THE OCEAN FLOOR FORMED A VALLEY
839-130898-0072 IN SIGHT OF LAND'S END IT PASSED BETWEEN THE LOWERMOST TIP OF ENGLAND AND THE SCILLY ISLANDS WHICH IT LEFT BEHIND TO STARBOARD IF IT WAS GOING TO ENTER THE ENGLISH CHANNEL
839-130898-0086 IT WAS SOME RUIN ENSHROUDED IN A CRUST OF WHITENED SEASHELLS AS IF UNDER A MANTLE OF SNOW CAREFULLY EXAMINING THIS MASS I COULD IDENTIFY THE SWOLLEN OUTLINES OF A SHIP SHORN
839-130898-0093 THE NEW REPUBLIC OF FRANCE CHANGED THE NAME OF THIS SHIP ON APRIL SIXTEENTH OF THAT SAME YEAR IT JOINED THE SQUADRON AT BREST UNDER REAR ADMIRAL
8419-286667-0000 THE DANCE OF THE SAND HILL CRANES ONE FINE DAY IN SPRING A GREAT FLOCK OF SAND HILL CRANES CAME FROM THE SOUTH THEY WERE FLYING HIGH AND QUIETLY BECAUSE THE WEATHER WAS BRIGHT IF IT HAD BEEN STORMY
8419-286667-0013 WHEN THEY WERE EATING THE YOUNG FELLOW WHO HAD BEGUN THE DANCE STALKED UP TO THE SISTER OF ONE OF HIS FRIENDS AS SHE STOOD IN THE EDGE OF THE POND GRACEFULLY BALANCED ON ONE LEG SHE DID NOT TURN HER HEAD TOWARDS HIM ALTHOUGH HAVING SUCH A LONG AND SLENDER NECK
8419-286667-0020 IF HE HAD BEEN AN OLDER CRANE AND UNDERSTOOD THE WAYS OF THE WORLD A LITTLE BETTER HE WOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT SHE MEANT AREN'T YOU COMING TO THAT FISHING PLACE I AM GOING NOW
8419-286667-0027 LET US GO OFF INTO THE WOODS AND REST YOU MAY BE VERY SURE HE WAS GLAD TO GO AND AS HE STALKED OFF WITH HER HE LED THE WAY TO A CHARMING NESTING PLACE HE DIDN'T KNOW JUST HOW TO TELL WHAT HE WANTED TO BUT HE HAD SEEN ANOTHER CRANE BOWING TO HER
8419-286676-0010 SHE COULD DO ALMOST ANYTHING AND SHE KNEW IT SHE TALKED ABOUT IT TOO AND THAT SHOWED BAD TASTE AND WAS ONE REASON WHY SHE WAS NOT LIKED BETTER SHE COULD SWIM VERY FAST COULD CREEP GLIDE
8419-286676-0017 LET THEM COME IN SWIMMING WITH THEIR CHILDREN IF THEY ARE WARM AND TIRED THE WATER ADDER LAUGHED IN HER SNAKY WAY AND SHOWED HER SHARP TEETH I HAVE HEARD SHE SAID THAT WHEN THE WILD DUCKS BRING THEIR CHILDREN HERE TO SWIM
8419-286676-0024 MOST OF THEM REMARKED THE TURTLES ALL OF THEM SHE SAID EXCEPT US ADDERS AND THE TURTLES I EVEN THINK THAT SOME OF THE TURTLES ARE A LITTLE QUEER DON'T YOU WE HAVE THOUGHT SO SAID THE MUD TURTLE
8419-293469-0004 ONE DAY WHEN MANY OF THE MEADOW PEOPLE WERE GATHERED AROUND HIM HE TOLD THEM HIS STORY WHEN I WAS A LITTLE FELLOW HE SAID I WAS STRONG AND WELL AND COULD LEAP FARTHER THAN ANY OTHER FROG OF MY SIZE
8419-293469-0011 I WAS A BOLD YOUNG FELLOW AND WHEN I SAW A GREAT WHITE THING AMONG THE TREES UP YONDER I MADE UP MY MIND TO SEE WHAT IT WAS THERE WAS A GREAT RED THING IN THE YARD BESIDE IT BUT I LIKED THE WHITE ONE BETTER
8419-293469-0018 SHE PUT ME IN A VERY QUEER PRISON AT FIRST WHEN SHE PUT ME DOWN ON A STONE IN SOME WATER I DID NOT KNOW THAT I WAS IN PRISON I TRIED TO HOP AWAY AND BUMP WENT MY HEAD AGAINST SOMETHING
8419-293473-0006 SOME MOTHERS DO NOT THINK IT TOO MUCH TROUBLE TO BE CAREFUL WHERE THEY LAY EGGS THAT MAY BE SAID THE BROWN WALKING STICK BUT THEY DO NOT BELONG TO OUR FAMILY SHE SPOKE AS IF THOSE WHO DID NOT BELONG TO HER FAMILY MIGHT BE GOOD BUT COULD NEVER BE GENTEEL
8419-293473-0013 THEIR FEELERS WERE HELD QUITE CLOSE TOGETHER AND THEY DID NOT MOVE THEIR FEET AT ALL ONLY SWAYED THEIR BODIES GRACEFULLY FROM SIDE TO SIDE NOW THEY WERE ON THE GROUND HUNTING THROUGH THE FLAT PILES OF CUT GRASS FOR SOME FRESH AND JUICY BITS TO EAT
8419-293473-0020 THE WALKING STICKS LOOKED VERY UNCOMFORTABLE AND THE BROTHER AND SISTER COULD NOT THINK OF ANYTHING TO SAY IT WAS THE YOUNG GREEN ONE WHO SPOKE AT LAST
8425-246962-0013 BUT TO SO MANY OF THE SECRET CHAMBERS OF THE SOULS OF THE CONGREGATION FOR WHAT A MAN DARES NOT COULD NOT IF HE DARED AND DARED NOT IF HE COULD SAY TO ANOTHER EVEN AT THE TIME AND IN THE PLACE FITTEST OF ALL
8425-246962-0020 WAS A KIND OF REVELATION TO HELEN FOR WHILE HIS INTELLECT WAS HANGING ABOUT THE DOOR ASKING QUESTIONS AND UNEASILY SHIFTING HITHER AND THITHER IN ITS UNLOVED PERPLEXITIES
8425-246962-0027 BUT HE FELT RIGHT HOPEFUL THAT EVEN WERE HE BASE ENOUGH TO DENY HIM ANY COCK MIGHT CROW HIM BACK TO REPENTANCE AT THE SAME TIME HE SAW PLAIN ENOUGH THAT EVEN IF HE GAVE HIS BODY TO BE BURNED
8425-287387-0010 THE TEMPLES ROSE IN THE TWINKLING OF AN EYE THE BASILICAS SHOT UP AS BY MAGIC THE GRAVEN IMAGES STOOD WHITE AGAINST THE ELUSIVE DEPTHS OF THE SKY AND THE VIA SACRA BECAME ALIVE
8425-287387-0017 NEITHER IN HIS MOTHER NOR IN HIS SISTERS DID HE FIND A STRAIN THAT SYMPATHIZED WITH HIS ECCENTRIC TENDENCIES AND SINCE THAT ONE FRIEND WHO DIED HE HAD NEVER FOUND ANOTHER AND HAD ALWAYS BEEN LONELY WITHIN
8425-287387-0024 BEING BY NATURE A LITTLE SHY OF BAEDEKERED TOURISTS OF SHORT SKIRTED ENGLISH LADIES WITH THEIR PERSISTENT LITTLE EXCLAMATIONS OF UNIFORM ADMIRATION AND FEELING ENTIRELY IMPOSSIBLE IN THE HALF ITALIAN
8425-291444-0005 EXCEPTING A FEW ERRORS IN ORTHOGRAPHY WHICH WAS FOUND IN THE ARCHIVES OF THE STUYVESANT FAMILY MANY LEGENDS LETTERS AND OTHER DOCUMENTS HAVE I LIKEWISE GLEANED IN MY RESEARCHES AMONG THE FAMILY CHESTS AND LUMBER GARRETS OF OUR RESPECTABLE
8425-291444-0012 CAREFULLY WINNOWING AWAY THE CHAFF OF HYPOTHESIS AND DISCARDING THE TARES OF FABLE WHICH ARE TOO APT TO SPRING UP AND CHOKE THE SEEDS OF TRUTH AND WHOLESOME KNOWLEDGE HAD I BEEN ANXIOUS TO CAPTIVATE THE SUPERFICIAL THRONG
8425-291444-0019 REUNITE THE THREAD OF GENERATIONS THE SAME SAD MISFORTUNE WHICH HAS HAPPENED TO SO MANY ANCIENT CITIES WILL HAPPEN AGAIN AND FROM THE SAME SAD CAUSE TO NINE TENTHS OF THOSE WHICH NOW FLOURISH ON THE FACE OF THE GLOBE
8425-292520-0013 LIGHT GREEN IN THE DEEPS LIKE YOUR EYES IN SUNSHINE WINDS THE CANAL LAZY AND BROWN AS A WATER SNAKE FULL OF DAZZLE AND SHEEN WHERE THE BREEZE SWEEPS THE WATER WITH GOSSAMER GARMENTS THAT SHAKE THE REEDS STANDING SENTINEL
8425-292520-0020 IN MEN'S HEARTS THE MAD GODS RISE AND FILL THE STREETS WITH REVELLING WITH TORCHLIGHT THAT GLANCES ON FROZEN POOLS WITH TAPERS STARRING THE THICK FOGGED NIGHT A DANCE LIKE STRAYED FIREFLIES
8425-292520-0027 BEHIND THOSE WALLS IN THOSE DARK STREETS LIKE THE SOUND OF A RIVER SWIFT UNSEEN FLOWING IN DARKNESS OH THE HOARSE HALF HEARD MURMUR SWIRLING BENEATH THE SNOWY BEAUTY OF MOONLIGHT
8465-246940-0010 I THOUGHT THAT PERHAPS EVEN IF HE MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO READ WHAT WAS IN MY HEART HE MIGHT BE ABLE TO HEAR MY VOICE I WAS EVEN FOOLISH ENOUGH TO WISH I KNEW GREEK BECAUSE PERHAPS HE WOULD UNDERSTAND ME BETTER IF I WERE TO PRAY IN GREEK
8465-246940-0024 AND SOMETIMES I MUCH FEAR THAT IN TAKING HOLY ORDERS I HAVE GRIEVOUSLY SINNED I SHOULD THEN DO JUST AS I HAVE DONE WITH REGARD TO THAT CRY TO THE LIVING POWER WHICH I THINK ORIGINATED ME TO SET THE MATTER RIGHT FOR ME
8465-246942-0006 HELEN DID NOT KNOW TO WHAT GULFS OF PERSONAL SHAME NAY TO WHAT SUMMITS OF PUBLIC EXECRATION A MAN MAY BE GLAD TO FLEE FOR REFUGE FROM THE FANGS OF HOME BORN GUILT IF SO BE THERE IS ANY REFUGE TO BE FOUND IN EITHER
8465-246942-0013 HE HAD ONLY SPOKEN DREARILY OF DUTY HINTING AT A HORROR THAT WOULD PLUNGE THE WHOLE ANCIENT FAMILY INTO A HELL OF DISHONOUR AND CONTEMPT
8465-246942-0020 NO SHE WOULD VENTURE NO FARTHER SOONER WOULD SHE GO TO GEORGE BASCOMBE FROM WHOM SHE NOT ONLY COULD LOOK FOR NO SPIRITUAL COMFORT BUT WHOSE THEORIES WERE SO CRUEL AGAINST CULPRITS OF ALL SORTS
8465-246943-0006 IS THERE NO HELP OF ANY KIND ANYWHERE SURELY MISTER WINGFOLD COULD TELL ME SOMETHING COMFORT ME SOMEHOW IF I WERE TO TELL HIM ALL ABOUT IT I COULD TRUST THE MAN THAT SAID SUCH THINGS AS THOSE YOU TOLD ME THAT I COULD
8465-246943-0013 INDEED WAS SHE NOT CERTAIN THAT SUCH A MAN BRINGING THE ARTILLERY OF HIS FANATICISM TO BEAR UPON HER POOR BOY'S WILD ENTHUSIASTIC TEMPERAMENT WOULD SPEEDILY PERSUADE HIM TO MAKE A REALITY OF THAT TERRIBLE THING HE HAD ALREADY THOUGHT OF THAT HIDEOUSLY IMPOSSIBLE POSSIBILITY
8465-246943-0020 BUT I THINK IN THEM ALL IS AN UNDERLYING UNCONSCIOUS HOPE I THINK THAT NOT ONE IN ALL THE WORLD HAS MORE THAN A SHADOWY NOTION OF WHAT HOPELESSNESS MEANS PERHAPS UTTER HOPELESSNESS IS THE OUTER DARKNESS
8465-246947-0004 AND WALKED WITH HIM THROUGH THE GARDEN WINGFOLD DID NOT SPEAK YOU DON'T THINK VERY BADLY OF MY POOR BROTHER DO YOU MISTER WINGFOLD SAID HELEN MEEKLY IT IS A TERRIBLE FATE HE RETURNED
8465-246947-0011 HER LOVE AND HER CONSCIENCE WERE NOT YET AT ONE WITH EACH OTHER THEY PARTED AT THE DOOR FROM THE GARDEN AND SHE RETURNED TO THE SICK ROOM SHE PAUSED HESITATING TO ENTER ALL WAS STILL AS THE GRAVE SHE TURNED THE HANDLE SOFTLY AND PEEPED IN
8465-246947-0018 HAD THE CURATE BEEN A MAN SHE LIKED SHE WOULD NOT PERHAPS HAVE MINDED IT SO MUCH YOU WILL BE ABLE TO DO WITHOUT ME NOW SHE SAID SADLY I NEVER COULD UNDERSTAND TAKING TO PEOPLE AT FIRST SIGHT SOME PEOPLE ARE MADE SO I SUPPOSE HELEN
8468-286673-0004 AND NOT AT ALL TOO CLOSE THEN THE SLOW LITTLE TURTLE CAME HURRYING OVER THE SAND WITH A RATHER CROSS LOOK IN HIS EYES AND PUTTING HIS FEET DOWN A LITTLE HARDER THAN HE NEEDED TO QUITE AS THOUGH HE WERE OUT OF PATIENCE ABOUT SOMETHING WHY DIDN'T YOU TURTLES WAIT FOR ME
8468-286673-0011 THE FIRST YEAR I HAD ONLY A FEW CHILDREN THE NEXT YEAR I HAD MORE AND SO IT HAS GONE EVERY YEAR A FEW MORE CHILDREN THAN THE YEAR BEFORE UNTIL NOW I NEVER KNOW QUITE HOW MANY I DO HAVE BUT THERE IS ALWAYS ONE SLOW LITTLE TURTLE
8468-286673-0018 OR BECAUSE HE WANTED TO DO THIS OR LOOK AT THAT OR TALK TO SOME OTHER PERSON HE WAS A VERY TRYING LITTLE TURTLE YET HIS MOTHER LOVED HIM AND DID NOT LIKE IT WHEN THE REST CALLED HIM A LAND TORTOISE IT IS ALL RIGHT YOU KNOW TO BE A LAND TORTOISE WHEN YOUR FATHER AND MOTHER ARE LAND TORTOISES
8468-286673-0032 I WISH I MIGHT HELP YOU SOME TIME
8468-286673-0039 HE IS THE QUICKEST ONE IN HIS FAMILY THE POND PEOPLE LOOKED AT EACH OTHER AND LAUGHED THAT IS QUEER THEY SAID AFTER THIS WE WILL CALL HIM THE QUICK LITTLE TURTLE THIS MADE HIM VERY HAPPY AND WHEN ONCE IN A WHILE SOMEBODY FORGOT
8468-294887-0005 THE VIGILANCE COMMITTEE FOR AIDING AND BEFRIENDING FUGITIVES OF WHICH I WAS TREASURER FOR MANY YEARS HAD NO BETTER OR WARMER FRIEND THAN HE HE WAS ALMOST ALWAYS AT THEIR MEETINGS WHICH WERE KNOWN ONLY TO THE ELECT FOR WE DARED NOT HOLD THEM TOO PUBLICLY
8468-294887-0019 TO WRITE SUCH AN ARTICLE AS WOULD BE WORTHY OF YOUR PUBLICATION HOWEVER FEELING SOMEWHAT RELIEVED TO DAY FROM MY PARALYSIS OWING TO THE CHEERING SUNSHINE AND THE FAVOR OF MY ALMIGHTY PRESERVER I WILL TRY TO DO WHAT I CAN IN DICTATING A FEW ANECDOTES TO MY AMANUENSIS
8468-294887-0026 A MISSUS MERCY SMITH BECKONED TO ME TO COME TO HER CLASS
8468-294887-0033 AND WHO HAD ESCAPED AND WERE SUPPOSED TO BE IN NEW YORK THE LETTER REQUESTED ME TO FIND THEM AND GIVE THEM WARNING AS THERE WAS NO TIME TO BE LOST I CONCLUDED TO GO OVER TO NEW YORK NOTWITHSTANDING THE DOUBTFULNESS OF ATTEMPTING TO FIND THEM IN SO LARGE A CITY
8468-295198-0004 NOW YOU COMPLAIN ALWAYS THAT YOUR HEAD ACHES WHENEVER I CALL UPON YOU IT'S ALL ON ACCOUNT OF THIS WAY OF SWINGING AND SWAYING ABOUT IN SUCH AN ABSURD MANNER BUT MY DEAR
8468-295198-0011 BUT THEN HE HAD A WEAKNESS FOR CONCERTS AND GENERAL SOCIETY BECAUSE HE WAS HELD TO BE BY ALL ODDS THE HANDSOMEST BIRD IN THE WOODS AND SUNG LIKE AN ANGEL AND SO THE TRUTH WAS HE DIDN'T CONFINE HIMSELF SO MUCH TO THE DOMESTIC NEST AS TOM TITMOUSE OR BILLY WREN
8468-295198-0018 WHICH OLD MOTHER NATURE HAD ALWAYS KEPT UP IN THOSE PARTS THEY PULLED THE YOUNG CHECKERBERRY BEFORE IT EVEN HAD TIME TO BLOSSOM ROOTED UP THE SASSAFRAS SHRUBS AND GNAWED THEIR ROOTS FIRED OFF GUNS AT THE BIRDS AND ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS
8468-295198-0031 GOT HIMSELF UNIVERSALLY LAUGHED AT FOR APING FASHIONABLE MANNERS EVERY BIRD AND BEAST IN THE FOREST HAD A GIBE AT HIM AND EVEN OLD PARSON TOO WHIT THOUGHT IT WORTH HIS WHILE TO MAKE HIM A PASTORAL CALL
8580-287363-0004 NOW MISTER DAMON IF YOU WILL JUST TAKE CHARGE OF THE STEERING APPARATUS FOR A MINUTE I WANT TO GO AFT WHAT FOR I WISH TO SEE IF EVERYTHING IS ALL RIGHT I CAN'T IMAGINE WHY ERADICATE WAS MAKING THOSE QUEER MOTIONS
8580-287363-0011 IT'S THE ONLY CRAFT THAT WILL SERVE OUR PURPOSE AMONG THE TOWERING MOUNTAIN PEAKS WHERE THE DIAMOND MAKERS ARE HIDDEN I HOPE WE CAN FIND THEM IN A LITTLE WHILE THE RED CLOUD WAS SKIMMING ALONG AT FASTER SPEED
8580-287363-0025 AND SHOWING THAT SCIENTIST SOME OF THE MANUFACTURED DIAMONDS GETTING OUR WIRELESS APPARATUS IN SHAPE ANSWERED THE LAD I SHOULD HAVE DONE IT BEFORE BUT I HAD SO MUCH TO DO THAT I COULDN'T GET AT IT
8580-287363-0032 BUT NO SOONER HAD THE YOUNG INVENTOR SENT OFF THE FIRST FEW DOTS AND DASHES REPRESENTING S I HIS HOME STATION CALL THAN HE STARTED AND A LOOK OF SURPRISE CAME OVER HIS FACE THEY'RE CALLING US HE EXCLAIMED WHO IS
8580-287364-0002 DID ERADICATE SEE THE MAN HE SAYS HE DID ANSWERED TOM THE MAN IS HIDDEN AWAY ON BOARD NOW PROBABLY AMONG THE STORES AND SUPPLIES BLESS MY TOMATO SAUCE EXPLODED MISTER DAMON
8580-287364-0016 PROBABLY HE WANTS TO WAIT UNTIL THE SHIP IS FARTHER OUT WEST SUGGESTED MISTER JENKS THEN HE WILL BE NEARER HIS FRIENDS AND CAN GET HELP IF HE NEEDS IT AND DO YOU REALLY BELIEVE HE WOULD DESTROY THE RED CLOUD ASKED MISTER PARKER
8580-287364-0023 THE BOX CONTAINING WHICH WAS WELL BACK IN THE ROOM THIS WOULD GIVE THE TWO A CHANCE TO PENETRATE TO THE FAR END OF THE APARTMENT WITHOUT AROUSING THE SUSPICIONS OF THE HIDDEN MAN WHO DOUBTLESS WOULD BE LISTENING TO THE CONVERSATION AND AS SOON AS WE GET SIGHT OF HIM
8580-287364-0030 HE WAS AWARE OF A MOVEMENT IN A LITTLE SPACE FORMED BY ONE BOX WHICH WAS PLACED ON TOP OF TWO OTHERS THE LAD SAW A DARK FIGURE MOVING AS IF TO GET FARTHER OUT OF SIGHT I'VE GOT HIM CRIED TOM MAKING A DIVE FOR THE SHADOW
8580-287364-0044 AND THEN GO ON BEFORE YOU CAN SEND ANY WORD TO YOUR CONFEDERATES WE'LL PUT YOU OFF IN THE MOST LONESOME SPOT WE CAN FIND AND I GUESS YOU'LL BE SOME TIME GETTING BACK TO CIVILIZATION BY THAT TIME WE'LL HAVE THE SECRET OF THE DIAMONDS YOU NEVER WILL
8609-262281-0001 CONSTANCE WOULD WILLINGLY HAVE COMMENCED THE DAILY ROUTINE AT AN EARLIER HOUR LADY AUGUSTA FREELY CONFESSED THAT TO COME EARLIER WOULD BE USELESS FOR SHE COULD NOT GET HER DAUGHTERS UP STRICTLY SPEAKING LADY AUGUSTA DID NOT PERSONALLY TRY TO GET THEM UP
8609-262281-0008 IT IS NOT FOR THAT I WISH TO GO SAID CAROLINE I THINK MEETINGS WHERE THERE'S NOTHING BUT TALKING ARE THE DULLEST THINGS IN THE WORLD IF I WERE TO LISTEN IT WOULD SEND ME TO SLEEP THEN WHY DO YOU WISH SO MUCH TO ATTEND THIS ONE BECAUSE I SHALL WEAR MY NEW DRESS

8609-262281-0029 THERE IS SO MUCH ILL TO UNDO CAROLINE IS THE WORST THE WEEDS WITH HER HAVE HAD LONGER TIME TO GET AHEAD I THINK PERHAPS IF I COULD KEEP HER WHOLLY WITH ME FOR A TWELVEMONTH OR SO WATCHING OVER HER CONSTANTLY A GREAT DEAL MIGHT BE EFFECTED
8609-262281-0036 THE CHANNINGS THEMSELVES WERE SILENT THEY COULD NOT SEE THE WAY AT ALL CLEAR WHEN MISTER YORKE WAS LEAVING HE BECKONED CONSTANCE AND ARTHUR INTO THE HALL
8609-283227-0006 WHO I MUST SAY HAD TAKEN MORE PAINS THAN MIGHT HAVE BEEN EXPECTED OF HIM TO MAKE HIMSELF ACQUAINTED WITH THE LEGALITIES OF HIS OFFICE DID NOT FAIL TO CALL A VESTRY TO WHICH AS USUAL NO ONE HAD RESPONDED WHEREUPON HE IMPOSED A RATE ACCORDING TO HIS OWN UNAIDED JUDGMENT THIS I BELIEVE
8609-283227-0013 PARTLY OF A DREAD LEST WE SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO GET ON TOGETHER AND SO THE ATTEMPT SHOULD RESULT IN SOMETHING UNPLEASANTLY AWKWARD I DARESAY LIKEWISE THAT THE NATURAL SHELLINESS OF THE ENGLISH HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH IT AT ALL EVENTS I HAD NOT MADE HIS ACQUAINTANCE
8609-283227-0020 NOW I SAID CARRY IT BACK INTO THE HOUSE WHY SIR INTERPOSED MISTER BROWNRIGG IT'S ALL RIGHT YES I SAID AS RIGHT AS THE DEVIL WOULD HAVE IT
8609-283227-0034 BUT BUT YOU MUSTN'T TALK MORE NOW SAID DOCTOR DUNCAN SO I SHOOK HANDS WITH MISTER BROWNRIGG AND WE PARTED I FEAR FROM WHAT I KNOW OF MY CHURCHWARDEN THAT HE WENT HOME WITH THE CONVICTION THAT HE HAD DONE PERFECTLY RIGHT
8609-283227-0041 I WANT IF YOU WILL ALLOW ME TO SHOW YOU THE PRINCIPLE UPON WHICH HE ACTED WITH REGARD TO CHURCH RATES CERTAINLY I BEG YOUR PARDON FOR INTERRUPTING YOU THE PHARISEES DEMANDED A TRIBUTE WHICH IT IS ALLOWED WAS FOR THE SUPPORT OF THE TEMPLE AND ITS WORSHIP
8609-283227-0048 BUT IS THERE NOT THIS DIFFERENCE THAT OUR LORD WAS AS YOU SAY A CHILD OF THE JEWISH CHURCH WHICH WAS INDUBITABLY ESTABLISHED BY GOD NOW IF I CANNOT CONSCIENTIOUSLY BELONG TO THE SO CALLED ENGLISH CHURCH WHY SHOULD I HAVE TO PAY CHURCH RATE OR TRIBUTE
8609-283227-0062 WHO WILL NOT HEAR ME PREACH TO THEM IN THE NAME AND LOVE OF GOD MISTER TEMPLETON SPEAK THAT YOU DO KNOW AND TESTIFY THAT YOU HAVE SEEN YOU AND I WILL HELP EACH OTHER IN PROPORTION AS WE SERVE THE MASTER
8609-283227-0069 I AM SURE THAT HIS FEELINGS WERE MODERATED EVEN CHANGED TOWARDS HER AND THOUGH THIS MAY SEEM OF NO CONSEQUENCE TO ONE WHO LOVES THE CHURCH MORE THAN THE BROTHERHOOD IT DOES NOT SEEM OF LITTLE CONSEQUENCE TO ME WHO LOVE THE CHURCH BECAUSE OF THE BROTHERHOOD OF WHICH IT IS THE TYPE AND THE RESTORER
8629-261139-0005 AND GLANCED AT THE GREAT DOOR OF ENTRANCE WITH AN EVIL EXPECTANCY THAT STARTLED EVEN SWEETWATER SO LITTLE HAD HE REALLY UNDERSTOOD THE NATURE OF THE PASSIONS LABOURING IN THAT VENOMOUS BREAST
8629-261139-0018 AND END FOREVER THE EFFECTS OF THE INTOLERABLE FASCINATION THAT WAS WORKING UPON HIM NEXT MINUTE THE LAST STROKE OF NOON RANG OUT AND THE HOUR WAS UP WHICH AMABEL HAD SET AS THE LIMIT OF HER SILENCE A PAUSE
8629-261139-0032 WAS ALMOST APPALLING IN ITS INTENSITY HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF MISTER SUTHERLAND'S NEAR PRESENCE THE FEELING WOULD HAVE RISEN TO OUTBREAK AND MANY VOICES WERE HELD IN SUBJECTION BY THE REMEMBRANCE OF THIS VENERATED MAN'S LAST LOOK
8629-261139-0046 ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT DOOR YONDER THAT SHE HAD REASONS FOR THIS GOOD REASONS REASONS OF WHICH UP TO THE VERY EVENING OF HER DEATH
8629-261139-0053 AND SO HASTENED ON TILL I CAME TO THE GATE ON HIGH STREET HERE I HAD A MOMENT OF HESITATION AND THOUGHTS BITTER ENOUGH FOR ME TO RECALL THEM AT THIS MOMENT CAME INTO MY MIND
8629-261139-0060 LAY IN THE GENEROSITY OF THIS GREAT HEARTED WOMAN AND IF OUT OF PUSILLANIMITY
8629-261139-0074 THERE ARE FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS ON THAT TABLE TAKE THEM AND LET THEM PAVE YOUR WAY TO A BETTER LIFE
8629-261140-0004 THE ASTOUNDING FACT WHICH I HAVE JUST COMMUNICATED TO YOU WAS MADE KNOWN BY MY MOTHER WITH THE DAGGER STILL PLUNGED IN HER BREAST SHE WOULD NOT LET ME DRAW IT OUT SHE KNEW THAT DEATH WOULD FOLLOW THAT ACT
8629-261140-0011 SHE ENJOINED ME NOT TO ENLIGHTEN HIM NOW IF BY ANY SACRIFICE ON MY PART I COULD RIGHTFULLY AVOID IT THAT SHE WAS HAPPY IN HAVING ME HEAR THE TRUTH BEFORE SHE DIED THAT THE JOY WHICH THIS GAVE HER WAS SO GREAT
8629-261140-0025 AND OF HOW ONE OF THEM JAMES BY NAME CAME TO BE INVOLVED IN THIS AFFAIR WHEN I LEFT MY DEAD MOTHER'S SIDE I WAS IN SUCH A STATE OF MIND THAT I PASSED WITH SCARCELY SO MUCH AS A GLANCE THE ROOM WHERE MY NEW FOUND FATHER SAT SLEEPING
8629-261140-0032 AND TOLD HIM OF THE STRANGE AND HEART RENDING ADVENTURE WHICH HAD CHANGED THE WHOLE TENOR OF MY THOUGHTS AND LIFE
8629-261140-0039 THEY BUT EMPHASISED FACTS ALREADY KNOWN AND PRODUCED BUT LITTLE CHANGE IN THE GENERAL FEELING
8630-305212-0002 DISGUSTED HIM IN HIS BETTER MOMENTS NEVERTHELESS HE WAS CONTENT TO ENJOY HIMSELF IN THEIR COMPANY HE WAS EVEN ASHAMED WHEN THEY BOASTED OF THEIR MISDOINGS TO SEEM MORE INNOCENT THAN THEY
8630-305212-0009 BUT HER TEACHING WAS NOT YET CLEAR TO HIM HIS OWN FEET WERE NOT FIRM ENOUGH IN THE WAYS OF CHRIST TO ENABLE HIM TO STRETCH A STEADYING HAND TO ANOTHER HIS MOTHER WAS FAILING FAST
8630-305212-0016 HE SUPPOSED IT WAS BECAUSE SHE WAS SO FULL OF SYMPATHY AND ALWAYS MADE ALLOWANCES AND THEN SHE SEEMED TO THINK TO BE SURE EVEN THAT IF ONE WENT ON TRYING FAILURES DID NOT MATTER
8630-305212-0030 AUGUSTINE WAS EAGER FOR KNOWLEDGE AND EAGER FOR ENJOYMENT HE FREQUENTED THE THEATRE HIS PLEASURE LOVING NATURE SNATCHED AT EVERYTHING THAT LIFE COULD GIVE YET HE WAS NOT HAPPY
8630-305212-0037 AND TO BE WAITING FOR THEM IN THEIR EVERLASTING HOME BUT MONICA'S HAPPINESS WAS TO BE SHORT LIVED FOR IT SEEMED THAT PATRICIUS WOULD SOON REJOIN HIS MOTHER
8630-305212-0044 SPOKE WORDS OF HOPE AND COMFORT ON THE THRESHOLD OF THAT OTHER WORLD MONICA BADE FAREWELL TO HER HUSBAND
8630-305213-0013 IT WAS A HAPPY MOMENT FOR MONICA WHEN HER TURN CAME TO SERVE THE SICK SHE WOULD KISS THEIR SORES FOR VERY PITY AS SHE WASHED AND DRESSED THEM AND THEIR FACES GREW BRIGHT AT HER COMING
8630-305213-0020 THE CUSTOM WAS ABOLISHED NOT LONG AFTER ON ACCOUNT OF THE ABUSES WHICH HAD ARISEN BUT MONICA OBSERVED IT TO THE END SHE SCARCELY TASTED OF HER OFFERING HERSELF
8630-305213-0027 HE WAS INFINITE IN MERCY AND STRONG TO SAVE HE HAD PROMISED THAT HE WOULD NEVER FAIL THOSE WHO PUT THEIR TRUST IN HIM AT HIS FEET AND AT HIS FEET ALONE
8630-305213-0041 OF THY SON MY SAVIOUR MY HEART HAD DRAWN IN WITH MY MOTHER'S MILK AND KEPT IN ITS DEPTHS AND EVERY DOCTRINE WHERE THIS NAME DID NOT APPEAR FLUENT ELEGANT AND TRUTH LIKE THOUGH IT MIGHT BE

8747-293952-0101 BUT TURNED THE CONVERSATION DEFIANTLY

8770-295462-0018 IT WOULD BE LIKE THE POPE'S BULL OR DECREE AGAINST THE COMET A DELEGATION OF CHICAGO MINISTERS CAME TO BEG MISTER LINCOLN TO FREE THE SLAVES HE PATIENTLY EXPLAINED TO THEM
8770-295462-0032 HE THEN PUT HIS HAND IN HIS TALL HAT THAT SAT UPON THE TABLE AND PULLED OUT A LITTLE PAPER TURNING TO THE MEMBERS OF THE CABINET HE SAID GENTLEMEN I HAVE CALLED YOU HERE UPON VERY IMPORTANT BUSINESS
8770-295463-0004 ACCOUNTED VICTORY ENOUGH FOR THE PRESIDENT TO ISSUE HIS EMANCIPATION PROCLAMATION PROVED TO BE A DRAWN BATTLE WITH TERRIFIC LOSSES ON BOTH SIDES LEE WAS DRIVEN BACK FROM MARYLAND THEN IT IS TRUE

8770-295463-0018 TO GARDNER'S GALLERY IN WASHINGTON WHERE HE HAD PROMISED TO SIT FOR HIS PHOTOGRAPH WHILE THERE HE SHOWED MISTER BROOKS A PROOF OF EVERETT'S ORATION WHICH HAD BEEN SENT TO HIM AS THIS PRINTED ADDRESS COVERED TWO NEWSPAPER PAGES
8770-295465-0004 MISTER LINCOLN TOOK HIS YOUNGEST SON WITH HIM EVERYWHERE ON HIS GREAT MISSION TO FORTRESS MONROE AND THEY THE LONG AND THE SHORT OF IT THE SOLDIERS SAID MARCHED HAND IN HAND THROUGH THE STREETS OF FALLEN RICHMOND
8770-295465-0011 AND HE WANTED ALL OTHER BOYS TO HAVE A FAIR SHOW HIS OWN FATHER HAD BEEN TOO HARD WITH HIM AND HE WAS GOING TO MAKE IT UP TO ALL THE OTHER BOYS HE COULD REACH THIS PASSION FOR DOING GOOD TO OTHERS
8770-295465-0018 BUT THEY WERE INBRED INTO THE DEEP UNDERSTANDING OF THE BIG FATHER AND THE SMALL SON WHO WERE LIVING IN THE WHITE HOUSE AS BOYS TOGETHER
8770-295465-0032 AND NOW HIS MOTHER WAS DESPERATELY ILL AND HIS FATHER HAD BEEN KILLED TAD OF COURSE COULD NOT COMPREHEND WHY ANY ONE COULD BE SO CRUEL AND WICKED AS TO WISH TO MURDER HIS DARLING PAPA DAY
8770-295465-0039 HE HAD CORRECTED THE IMPERFECTION IN HIS SPEECH BUT THE HEART OF LITTLE TAD HAD BEEN BROKEN WHILE STILL A LAD HE JOINED HIS FOND FATHER IN THE BEYOND GIVE THE BOYS A CHANCE HAD AMOUNTED TO A PASSION WITH ABRAHAM LINCOLN
8797-294123-0005 HE IS PREPARED TO BOUND AWAY ON HIS LONG LEGS AT THE FIRST HINT OF DANGER OR TROUBLE NORTHERN KOREA WAS A DESOLATE LAND WHEN THE JAPANESE PASSED THROUGH VILLAGES AND TOWNS WERE DESERTED

8797-294123-0047 TRULY WOULD HE OF HIMSELF CONSTITUTE THE MUCH HERALDED YELLOW PERIL WERE IT NOT FOR HIS PRESENT MANAGEMENT THIS MANAGEMENT HIS GOVERNMENT IS SET CRYSTALLIZED IT IS WHAT BINDS HIM DOWN TO BUILDING AS HIS FATHERS BUILT
8797-294123-0054 THE INFUSION OF OTHER BLOOD MALAY PERHAPS HAS MADE THE JAPANESE A RACE OF MASTERY AND POWER A FIGHTING RACE THROUGH ALL ITS HISTORY A RACE WHICH HAS ALWAYS DESPISED COMMERCE AND EXALTED FIGHTING TO DAY
8797-294123-0061 HE WOULD SEE THE WESTERN GIANTS IN POSSESSION OF THE VERY STUFF OF HIS DREAM THE MENACE TO THE WESTERN WORLD LIES NOT IN THE LITTLE BROWN MAN BUT IN THE FOUR HUNDRED MILLIONS OF YELLOW MEN SHOULD THE LITTLE BROWN MAN UNDERTAKE THEIR MANAGEMENT

8797-294123-0089 AS ONE JAPANESE HAS WRITTEN OUR REFLECTION BROUGHT INTO PROMINENCE NOT SO MUCH THE MORAL AS THE NATIONAL CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE INDIVIDUAL TO US THE COUNTRY IS MORE THAN LAND AND SOIL FROM WHICH TO MINE GOLD OR REAP GRAIN

8838-298545-0006 I HAVE A GREAT FAVOUR TO ASK OF YOU THE DOCTOR'S APPEARANCE WAS NOT ENCOURAGING HIS MOUTH SUDDENLY TIGHTENED AND HIS EYES FELL YES MISTER MONTGOMERY YOU ARE AWARE SIR THAT I NEED ONLY ONE MORE SESSION TO COMPLETE MY COURSE
8838-298545-0013 AND THE JAW AND THROAT OF A BULLDOG LOOK Y'ERE SAID HE AGAIN WHY HAST THOU NOT SENT T MEDICINE OOP AS THY MASTER ORDERED MONTGOMERY HAD BECOME ACCUSTOMED TO THE BRUTAL FRANKNESS OF THE NORTHERN WORKER AT FIRST IT HAD ENRAGED HIM
8838-298545-0026 AND DOWN FOR THE EASTER VACATION FROM MAGDALENE COLLEGE HE SAT NOW UPON THE EDGE OF THE SURGERY TABLE LOOKING IN THOUGHTFUL SILENCE AT MONTGOMERY AND TWISTING THE ENDS OF HIS SMALL BLACK WAXED MOUSTACHE THE SECOND WAS PURVIS THE PUBLICAN
8838-298545-0033 GOOD LAD HE'LL DO YET CRIED PURVIS GENTLEMEN SAID MONTGOMERY I THINK THAT YOU WILL ACKNOWLEDGE THAT I HAVE BOON VERY PATIENT WITH YOU
8838-298545-0040 HOWEVER THAT'S NEITHER HERE NOR THERE MONTGOMERY LOOKED AT THEM IN BEWILDERMENT FOR GOODNESS SAKE GENTLEMEN TELL ME WHAT IT IS YOU WANT ME TO DO HE CRIED WE WANT YOU TO FIGHT SILAS CRAGGS BETTER KNOWN AS THE MASTER OF CROXLEY
8838-298546-0001 IN WHICH HE HAD THE WORST OF IT BUT HAD MADE THE PRIZE FIGHTER STRETCH HIMSELF TO THE UTTERMOST THERE WAS HIS WHOLE RECORD AND WAS IT ENOUGH TO ENCOURAGE HIM TO STAND UP TO THE MASTER OF CROXLEY HE HAD NEVER HEARD OF THE MASTER BEFORE
8838-298546-0008 WHO HOLDS THE STRONGEST AND MOST HONOURABLE POSITION HIS CONSCIENCE GAVE HIM NO CONCERN UPON THE SUBJECT ENDURANCE AND COURAGE ARE VIRTUES NOT VICES AND BRUTALITY IS AT LEAST BETTER THAN EFFEMINACY
8838-298546-0015 BORN IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY SEVEN SAID THE PROVINCIAL BIOGRAPHER SILAS CRAGGS BETTER KNOWN IN SPORTING CIRCLES AS THE MASTER OF CROXLEY IS NOW IN HIS FORTIETH YEAR HANG IT I'M ONLY TWENTY THREE
8838-298546-0029 TALL ENOUGH FOR ANYTHING ON TWO LEGS AS THE OLD RING MEN USED TO SAY LITHE AND SPARE WITH THE ACTIVITY OF A PANTHER AND A STRENGTH WHICH HAD HARDLY YET EVER FOUND ITS LIMITATIONS HIS MUSCULAR DEVELOPMENT WAS FINELY HARD
8838-298546-0036 OF COURSE IF YOU INSIST UPON YOUR FORMAL RIGHTS THERE IS NO MORE TO BE SAID MISTER MONTGOMERY THOUGH I FEEL THAT IT SHOWS A CERTAIN INDIFFERENCE TO MY COMFORT AND THE WELFARE OF THE PRACTICE DO YOU STILL INSIST YES SIR VERY GOOD HAVE YOUR WAY
8838-298546-0043 HE KEPT POKING HIS FINGER INTO MONTGOMERY AS IF HE WERE ONE OF HIS HORSES I HEAR THAT THE MASTER WILL SCALE A HUNDRED AND SIXTY ODD AT THE RING SIDE BUT THERE'S SOME OF THAT WHICH HE'D LIKE WELL TO PULL OFF AND LEAVE BEHIND WI HIS SHIRT SAID PURVIS
887-123289-0003 I WANTED A WHOLE HOUR TO RECOVER EVEN A LITTLE BUT A DELUGE OF RAIN WAS STILL FALLING THOUGH WITH THAT VIOLENCE WHICH GENERALLY DENOTES THE NEAR CESSATION OF A STORM
887-123289-0010 BUT MY DEAR UNCLE DO LET ME ASK YOU ONE QUESTION OF COURSE AXEL HOW ABOUT RETURNING RETURNING WHY YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT THE RETURN BEFORE THE ARRIVAL NO
887-123289-0017 AFTER HAVING RISKED BLOWING UP DURING THE STORM WELL CRIED THE PROFESSOR AS WE HAVE NO GUNS WE CANNOT HUNT THAT'S ALL YES BUT HOW ABOUT THE INSTRUMENTS HERE IS THE ANEROID THE MOST USEFUL OF ALL
887-123289-0031 SURELY AXEL IT MAY VIE IN SIZE WITH THE MEDITERRANEAN ITSELF ESPECIALLY I REPLIED IF IT HAPPENS THAT WE HAVE ONLY CROSSED IT IN ITS NARROWEST PART AND IT IS A CURIOUS CIRCUMSTANCE I ADDED THAT IF MY COMPUTATIONS ARE RIGHT
887-123289-0038 AN EXCLAMATION OF ASTONISHMENT BURST FROM ME THE NORTH POLE OF THE NEEDLE WAS TURNED TO WHAT WE SUPPOSED TO BE THE SOUTH IT POINTED TO THE SHORE INSTEAD OF TO THE OPEN SEA I SHOOK THE BOX EXAMINED IT AGAIN
887-123290-0005 I WAS ABLE TO DEVELOP THIS SERIES OF UNANSWERABLE REASONS FOR TEN MINUTES WITHOUT INTERRUPTION NOT THAT THE PROFESSOR WAS PAYING ANY RESPECTFUL ATTENTION TO HIS NEPHEW'S ARGUMENTS BUT BECAUSE HE WAS DEAF TO ALL MY ELOQUENCE
887-123290-0019 IT MUST BE BELIEVED THAT THAT FISSURE IS NOW CLOSED AND THAT ALL THIS CAVERN OR IMMENSE RESERVOIR WAS FILLED IN A VERY SHORT TIME PERHAPS EVEN THIS WATER SUBJECTED TO THE FIERCE ACTION OF CENTRAL HEAT HAD PARTLY BEEN RESOLVED INTO VAPOUR
887-123290-0026 A THOUSAND CUVIERS COULD NEVER HAVE RECONSTRUCTED THE ORGANIC REMAINS DEPOSITED IN THIS MAGNIFICENT AND UNPARALLELED COLLECTION I STOOD AMAZED MY UNCLE HAD UPLIFTED HIS LONG ARMS TO THE VAULT WHICH WAS OUR SKY
887-123291-0001 IN A PALAEONTOLOGICAL POINT OF VIEW WHICH HAD OCCURRED A LITTLE WHILE BEFORE OUR DEPARTURE ON THE TWENTY EIGHTH OF MARCH EIGHTEEN SIXTY THREE
887-123291-0015 AND FINGER AND TOE NAILS OF FRIGHTFUL LENGTH THIS DESICCATED MUMMY STARTLED US BY APPEARING JUST AS IT HAD LIVED COUNTLESS AGES AGO I STOOD MUTE BEFORE THIS APPARITION OF REMOTE ANTIQUITY MY UNCLE USUALLY SO GARRULOUS
887-123291-0022 I HAVE READ THE REPORTS OF THE SKELETON OF TRAPANI FOUND IN THE FOURTEENTH CENTURY AND WHICH WAS AT THE TIME IDENTIFIED AS THAT OF POLYPHEMUS AND THE HISTORY OF THE GIANT UNEARTHED IN THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY NEAR PALERMO
887-123291-0029 IT IS NOT A MERE SKELETON IT IS AN ENTIRE BODY
89-218-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY ONE A MOMENT'S GLANCE WAS ENOUGH TO SATISFY CATHERINE THAT HER APARTMENT WAS VERY UNLIKE THE ONE WHICH HENRY HAD ENDEAVOURED TO ALARM HER BY THE DESCRIPTION OF IT WAS BY NO MEANS UNREASONABLY LARGE AND CONTAINED NEITHER TAPESTRY NOR VELVET
89-218-0007 BROKEN PERHAPS PREMATURELY BY SOME STRANGE VIOLENCE AND ON THE CENTRE OF THE LID WAS A MYSTERIOUS CIPHER IN THE SAME METAL CATHERINE BENT OVER IT INTENTLY BUT WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO DISTINGUISH ANYTHING WITH CERTAINTY SHE COULD NOT IN WHATEVER DIRECTION SHE TOOK IT
89-218-0014 ENTERED THE ROOM AND TO THE RISING SHAME OF HAVING HARBOURED FOR SOME MINUTES AN ABSURD EXPECTATION WAS THEN ADDED THE SHAME OF BEING CAUGHT IN SO IDLE A SEARCH
89-218-0027 THE WIND HAD BEEN RISING AT INTERVALS THE WHOLE AFTERNOON AND BY THE TIME THE PARTY BROKE UP IT BLEW AND RAINED VIOLENTLY CATHERINE AS SHE CROSSED THE HALL LISTENED TO THE TEMPEST WITH SENSATIONS OF AWE AND WHEN SHE HEARD IT RAGE ROUND A CORNER OF THE ANCIENT BUILDING AND CLOSE WITH SUDDEN FURY A DISTANT DOOR
89-218-0041 THE WIND ROARED DOWN THE CHIMNEY THE RAIN BEAT IN TORRENTS AGAINST THE WINDOWS AND EVERYTHING SEEMED TO SPEAK THE AWFULNESS OF HER SITUATION
89-218-0055 SHE HAD NOT BEEN USED TO FEEL ALARM FROM WIND BUT NOW EVERY BLAST SEEMED FRAUGHT WITH AWFUL INTELLIGENCE THE MANUSCRIPT SO WONDERFULLY FOUND SO WONDERFULLY ACCOMPLISHING THE MORNING'S PREDICTION HOW WAS IT TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR WHAT COULD IT CONTAIN
89-219-0004 SHIRTS STOCKINGS CRAVATS AND WAISTCOATS FACED HER IN EACH TWO OTHERS PENNED BY THE SAME HAND MARKED AN EXPENDITURE SCARCELY MORE INTERESTING IN LETTERS HAIR POWDER SHOE STRING AND BREECHES BALL AND THE LARGER SHEET
89-219-0011 AS A MEANS OF GETTING YOU OUT OF DOORS AND TEMPTING YOU TO MORE FREQUENT EXERCISE THAN YOU WOULD OTHERWISE TAKE AND THOUGH THE LOVE OF A HYACINTH MAY BE RATHER DOMESTIC WHO CAN TELL THE SENTIMENT ONCE RAISED BUT YOU MAY IN TIME COME TO LOVE A ROSE
89-219-0025 AND THOUGH CATHERINE HAD HOPED TO EXPLORE IT ACCOMPANIED ONLY BY HIS DAUGHTER IT WAS A PROPOSAL OF TOO MUCH HAPPINESS IN ITSELF UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES NOT TO BE GLADLY ACCEPTED
89-219-0032 IF HENRY HAD BEEN WITH THEM INDEED BUT NOW SHE SHOULD NOT KNOW WHAT WAS PICTURESQUE WHEN SHE SAW IT SUCH WERE HER THOUGHTS BUT SHE KEPT THEM TO HERSELF AND PUT ON HER BONNET IN PATIENT DISCONTENT SHE WAS STRUCK HOWEVER BEYOND HER EXPECTATION BY THE GRANDEUR OF THE ABBEY
89-219-0039 WITHOUT ANY AMBITION OF THAT SORT HIMSELF WITHOUT ANY SOLICITUDE ABOUT IT HE DID BELIEVE THEM TO BE UNRIVALLED IN THE KINGDOM IF HE HAD A HOBBY HORSE IT WAS THAT HE LOVED A GARDEN THOUGH CARELESS ENOUGH IN MOST MATTERS OF EATING HE LOVED GOOD FRUIT
89-219-0053 MISS TILNEY CONTINUING SILENT SHE VENTURED TO SAY HER DEATH MUST HAVE BEEN A GREAT AFFLICTION A GREAT AND INCREASING ONE REPLIED THE OTHER IN A LOW VOICE
89-219-0060 IT IS VERY LIKE HERE WAS ANOTHER PROOF A PORTRAIT VERY LIKE OF A DEPARTED WIFE NOT VALUED BY THE HUSBAND HE MUST HAVE BEEN DREADFULLY CRUEL TO HER
8975-270782-0002 SO WE CALLED THE MODE OF EXPRESSION OF THE DREAM WORK THE ARCHAIC OR REGRESSIVE YOU MAY CONCLUDE THAT AS A RESULT OF THE DEEPER STUDY OF THE DREAM WORK WE GAIN VALUABLE INFORMATION ABOUT THE RATHER UNKNOWN BEGINNINGS OF OUR INTELLECTUAL DEVELOPMENT I TRUST THIS WILL BE TRUE
8975-270782-0016 HAVE BELONGED TO THE UNCONSCIOUS BUT SOMETIMES THEY BOB UP OUT OF THE UNCONSCIOUS SPONTANEOUSLY AND AS A MATTER OF FACT THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS IN DREAMS IT IS APPARENT THAT THE DREAM LIFE KNOWS HOW TO FIND THE ENTRANCE TO THESE LATENT
8975-270782-0023 WE NEED NOT HESITATE TO POINT OUT THIS ORIGIN THESE EVIL WISH IMPULSES HAVE THEIR ORIGIN IN THE PAST OFTEN IN A PAST WHICH IS NOT TOO FAR AWAY
8975-270782-0030 ONLY WISH TO WARN YOU THAT YOU ARE TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION NOT THE EXACT TERMS OF THE DREAM BUT THE MEANING THEREOF ACCORDING TO ITS INTERPRETATION IT MAY HAPPEN THAT THE MANIFEST DREAM OF THE DEATH OF SOME LOVED PERSON HAS ONLY MADE USE OF SOME FRIGHTFUL MASK
8975-270782-0044 SUBSEQUENTLY EVERY OPPORTUNITY IS MADE USE OF TO DISPARAGE THE NEW ARRIVAL AND EVEN ATTEMPTS TO DO HIM BODILY HARM DIRECT ATTACKS ARE NOT UNHEARD OF
8975-270782-0051 THIS IS IN ACCORD WITH OUR EXPECTATION WE FIND IT MUCH MORE OFFENSIVE FOR LOVE BETWEEN PARENTS AND CHILDREN TO BE LACKING THAN FOR LOVE BETWEEN BROTHERS AND SISTERS WE HAVE SO TO SPEAK MADE SOMETHING HOLY IN THE FIRST INSTANCE
8975-270782-0058 THE LATTER AFFORDS THE PUREST EXAMPLES OF AN UNALTERABLE TENDERNESS IN NO WAY DISTURBED BY EGOISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS WHY DO I SPEAK OF THESE THINGS SO BANAL AND SO WELL KNOWN
8975-270782-0072 AND PERSONS WHO HAD NEGLECTED TO TAKE PART IN DENYING THIS PROSCRIBED OR TABOOED FEELING RELATIONSHIP LATER MADE GOOD THE OMISSION BY TAKING ALL VALUE FROM THE COMPLEX THROUGH FALSE INTERPRETATIONS ACCORDING TO MY UNCHANGED CONVICTION
8975-270782-0079 WHAT WE CALL PERVERSE IN THE LIFE OF THE ADULT DIFFERS FROM THE NORMAL IN THE FOLLOWING RESPECTS FIRST IN DISREGARD FOR THE DIVIDING LINE OF SPECIES THE GULF BETWEEN MAN AND ANIMAL SECOND
8975-270782-0086 AND THEN AT THE WRITING TABLE DEFEND THE SEXUAL PURITY OF THE SAME CHILDREN WHERE CHILDREN ARE LEFT TO THEMSELVES OR ARE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF CORRUPTION
8975-270782-0100 ARE ASHAMED AND ANGRY IF ONE OF THESE DREAMS HAS IN SOME UNUSUAL MANNER SUCCEEDED IN PENETRATING INTO CONSCIOUSNESS IN AN UNDISTORTED FORM
8975-270782-0107 HOW DOES ONE SOLVE THIS CONTRADICTION WE BEGIN TO SEE THAT A DISTINCTION MUST BE MADE SOMETHING THAT ORIGINATES IN OUR CONSCIOUS LIFE AND THAT SHARES ITS CHARACTERISTICS
8975-270782-0114 THAT ONLY IN THIS MANNER CAN A DREAM BE BUILT UP
909-131041-0012 THEY HAVE NOT MADE THE APPOINTMENT OF THE PRESIDENT TO DEPEND ON ANY PREEXISTING BODIES OF MEN WHO MIGHT BE TAMPERED WITH BEFOREHAND TO PROSTITUTE THEIR VOTES BUT THEY HAVE REFERRED IT IN THE FIRST INSTANCE TO AN IMMEDIATE ACT OF THE PEOPLE OF AMERICA
909-131041-0019 THIS ADVANTAGE WILL ALSO BE SECURED BY MAKING HIS RE ELECTION TO DEPEND ON A SPECIAL BODY OF REPRESENTATIVES DEPUTED BY THE SOCIETY FOR THE SINGLE PURPOSE OF MAKING THE IMPORTANT CHOICE ALL THESE ADVANTAGES WILL HAPPILY COMBINE IN THE PLAN DEVISED BY THE CONVENTION
909-131041-0026 PRE EMINENT FOR ABILITY AND VIRTUE AND THIS WILL BE THOUGHT NO INCONSIDERABLE RECOMMENDATION OF THE CONSTITUTION BY THOSE WHO ARE ABLE TO ESTIMATE THE SHARE WHICH THE EXECUTIVE IN EVERY GOVERNMENT MUST NECESSARILY HAVE IN ITS GOOD OR ILL ADMINISTRATION
909-131044-0008 THE REPUBLICAN PRINCIPLE DEMANDS THAT THE DELIBERATE SENSE OF THE COMMUNITY SHOULD GOVERN THE CONDUCT OF THOSE TO WHOM THEY INTRUST THE MANAGEMENT OF THEIR AFFAIRS BUT IT DOES NOT REQUIRE AN UNQUALIFIED COMPLAISANCE TO EVERY SUDDEN BREEZE OF PASSION
909-131044-0015 THE LATTER MAY SOMETIMES STAND IN OPPOSITION TO THE FORMER AND AT OTHER TIMES THE PEOPLE MAY BE ENTIRELY NEUTRAL IN EITHER SUPPOSITION IT IS CERTAINLY DESIRABLE THAT THE EXECUTIVE SHOULD BE IN A SITUATION TO DARE TO ACT HIS OWN OPINION WITH VIGOR AND DECISION
909-131044-0022 CAN AFFECT THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE EXECUTIVE ON THE LEGISLATURE UNLESS THE ONE WERE POSSESSED OF THE POWER OF APPOINTING OR DISPLACING THE OTHER ONE ANSWER TO THIS INQUIRY MAY BE DRAWN FROM THE PRINCIPLE ALREADY REMARKED
909-131045-0002 THE APPLICATION AND DISBURSEMENT OF THE PUBLIC MONEYS IN CONFORMITY TO THE GENERAL APPROPRIATIONS OF THE LEGISLATURE THE ARRANGEMENT OF THE ARMY AND NAVY THE DIRECTIONS OF THE OPERATIONS OF WAR
909-131045-0009 THE FIRST IS NECESSARY TO GIVE TO THE OFFICER HIMSELF THE INCLINATION AND THE RESOLUTION TO ACT HIS PART WELL AND TO THE COMMUNITY TIME AND LEISURE TO OBSERVE THE TENDENCY OF HIS MEASURES AND THENCE TO FORM AN EXPERIMENTAL ESTIMATE OF THEIR MERITS
909-131045-0016 INSTEAD OF THE POSITIVE MERIT OF DOING GOOD ANOTHER ILL EFFECT OF THE EXCLUSION WOULD BE THE TEMPTATION TO SORDID VIEWS TO PECULATION AND IN SOME INSTANCES TO USURPATION
909-131045-0030 IN THE MANNER BEST SUITED TO ITS EXIGENCIES AND CIRCUMSTANCES WITHOUT SUPPOSING THE PERSONAL ESSENTIALITY OF THE MAN IT IS EVIDENT THAT A CHANGE OF THE CHIEF MAGISTRATE AT THE BREAKING OUT OF A WAR OR AT ANY SIMILAR CRISIS FOR ANOTHER
909-131045-0037 WHAT ARE THE ADVANTAGES PROMISED TO COUNTERBALANCE THESE DISADVANTAGES THEY ARE REPRESENTED TO BE FIRST GREATER INDEPENDENCE IN THE MAGISTRATE
911-128684-0000 ARE AS DUALISTIC AS IT IS POSSIBLE TO BE THOUGHTS WE ALL NATURALLY THINK ARE MADE OF ONE KIND OF SUBSTANCE AND THINGS OF ANOTHER CONSCIOUSNESS FLOWING INSIDE OF US IN THE FORMS OF CONCEPTION OR JUDGMENT
911-128684-0014 IS A NATURAL CONSEQUENCE OF THE EXTREMELY COMPLEX RETICULATIONS IN WHICH OUR EXPERIENCES COME TO HER OFFSPRING A TIGRESS IS TENDER BUT CRUEL TO EVERY OTHER LIVING THING
911-128684-0021 IN THE PARAGRAPHS THAT FOLLOW I SHALL TRY TO SHOW ONE THAT THE POPULAR NOTION THAT THESE EXPERIENCES ARE INTUITIVELY GIVEN AS PURELY INNER FACTS IS HASTY AND ERRONEOUS AND TWO
911-128684-0028 THEY ARE SIMULTANEOUSLY AFFECTIONS OF THE BODY
911-128684-0042 PUBLISHED BY SIDIS AND GOODHART IN THEIR IMPORTANT WORK ON MULTIPLE PERSONALITY WE READ THAT WHEN THE PATIENT FIRST RECOVERED CONSCIOUSNESS AND
911-128684-0049 OR AS RIGOROUSLY PHYSICAL FACTS SO THEY REMAIN EQUIVOCAL AND AS THE WORLD GOES THEIR EQUIVOCALITY IS ONE OF THEIR GREAT CONVENIENCES
911-128684-0056 HARDNESS AND SOFTNESS ARE EFFECTS ON US OF ATOMIC INTERACTIONS AND THE ATOMS THEMSELVES ARE NEITHER HARD NOR SOFT NOR SOLID NOR LIQUID SIZE AND SHAPE ARE DEEMED SUBJECTIVE BY KANTIANS
911-128684-0070 THAT PRIMARILY APPEAL TO OUR ATTENTION IN OUR COMMERCE WITH NATURE THESE ATTRIBUTES ARE WHAT GIVE EMPHASIS TO OBJECTS AND FOR AN OBJECT TO BE EMPHATIC WHATEVER SPIRITUAL FACT IT MAY MEAN
911-128684-0077 AND THE PURPOSES THEY SUBSERVE BY THEIR AFFECTIVE VALUES IN SHORT THAT THEIR CONSECUTION IN OUR SEVERAL CONSCIOUS STREAMS AS THOUGHTS OF OURS IS MAINLY RULED DESIRE INTRODUCES THEM INTEREST HOLDS THEM
911-128684-0084 IT DOES NOT FUNCTION AS A PHYSICAL QUALITY BUT THE CARRION TURNS OUR STOMACH BY WHAT SEEMS A DIRECT OPERATION IT DOES FUNCTION PHYSICALLY THEREFORE IN THAT LIMITED PART OF PHYSICS
911-130578-0006 HE ASKED HER WHAT SHE WAS EATING SOME PULSE I GOT FROM THE VILLAGE HEADMAN GIVE ME A LITTLE TO TRY HE BEGGED I AM SORRY MY CHILD I HAVE FINISHED IT ALL
911-130578-0013 THE SIGHT OF THEM FRIGHTENED HIM AND HE SANG DRINK YOUR FILL TIGER I SHALL NOT SHOOT YOU
911-130578-0020 I MUST HAVE BEEN ASLEEP A VERY LONG TIME THEN HIS SON EXPLAINED TO HIM ALL THAT HAD HAPPENED AND GAVE HIM SOME FOOD
